A collection of sententiae on Horace's savorite theme: ‘a conteuted
spirit is beyond all other possessious.³

‘Peace is the prayer oi all men-the sailor on the stormy sea, the
warlike Thracian and Mede. Peace thou canst not buy. N either wealth
nor power will drive away men's wretched cares. He only lives well who
lives on little, undistressed by sear or greed. Why should we move
from land to laud aud put forth our weak efforts? Care follows hard
upon us. No, life is mingled sweet and bitter, and all things have their
compensation. Perhaps the flitting hour gives me something thou hast

phus recommended by Horace, Epist. 1, 12, 22-24, to his friend iccius

estates in Sicily. That Grosphus also had large possessious there is
evident from vv. 33-37, but that he was stilla man who could appreciate

character given him in the epistle mentioned above, nil nari verum
orabit et aequum.

The exact date of composition cannot be determined, but the meu·
tion of Thrace and the Medes may point to a date before 27 B.c. lu

lasted him through life. ⁴
In the autumn of 44 rac. Brutus came to Athens, where the
people received him with enthusiasm as a liberator. The young
Roman nobles and Horace as well were attracted to his cause.
Why the freedman's son was given the office of military tribune in
the conspirators' army—a position for which he had no training—
it is hard to say, and the appointment not unnaturally aroused
envy at the time. It is probable, however, that Horace had
μ already made some reputation among his fellow students asa
skillful versifier, and Brutus’ love of literature induced him to
prefer the youth. Of Horace's military service we know little;
his writings show a familiarity with some islands of the Aegean
and the famous cities of Asia, which was probably gained at this
time, and it is certain that he shared in the defeat at Philippi in

accepted the new order of things at first despairing of the state;
but later, after the battle of Actium had freed Rome from external
dangers, he enthusiastically proclaimed the permanence of the
Empire and celebrated the beneficence of Augustus’ rule. But
his entire life aster his experience at Philippi was that of a man of
letters, who mixed much with men rather as an observer than as a
participant in their lif . His later history falls into three periods
of about ten years each: first, from his retum to Rome to 29 rae,
the period during which he published his two books of Satires and
the collection of Epodes,· second, 29-19 rao, the period of
his maturity, in which his genius reached its height. During

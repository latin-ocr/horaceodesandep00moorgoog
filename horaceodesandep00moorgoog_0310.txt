CARMINA [3, 24, 5

of sin is death (1-24). He who will be known as father of the state,
must check the current license‚ trusting to posterity for his reward
(25-32). Our sin must be cut out, laws without the support of charac-
ter are vain. The source of our sin is greed for gain, so that neither
torrid heat nor northern cold check the eager trader3 for gold men do
and suffer all. Poverty alone is great disgrace. Then let us dedicate
to Jove or cast into the sea our gems and gold if we are really penitent
(33-50). Present luxury is too great. Our boys must be trained in a
sterner school. To-day no freeborn youth can ride his horse3 yet he
is well skilled in weaker sports and dice. Honor and fidelity are gone.
Riches will still grow to harm, but never satisfy (51-64).'

This moralizing on riches as the source of evil is similar to much in
the opening odes of this book, especially to 3, 1, 14-44. Cf. also 2, 15 3
163 183 Epod. 16. The savior invoked in vv. 25 ff. is clearly Augustus,
who endeavored by legislation and example to check the growing
license of his time. His success was only slight and temporary in
spite of his words Mon. Anc. a, 12—14 legibus novtlr latis complura ex-
empla maiorum exolentia iam ex nostro usu reduxi et ipse multarum
rerum exempla imitanda posteris tradedi. The date of composition
cannot be determined‚ but probably the ode was written at about the
same time as 3, 1-6. Metre, 71.

CARMINA [3‚ 17, 8

These verses are addressed to L. Aelius Latina, apparently the friend
named 1, 26, 8 (cs. 36, 8). The Lamian family was not prominent
before Cicero's time and the name does not appear in the consular fasti
until 2 Α.Ι).; during the first century of our era, however, the house
was one of the most distinguished. The Lamus to whom Horace play-
fully refers his friend's ancestry is none other than Homer's cannibal
king'of the Laestrygonians‚ Od. 10, 81. The scene is Lamia's country
place3 the occasion unknown. Metre, 68.

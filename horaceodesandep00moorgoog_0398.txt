this was intentional and marked no falling off in Horace's skill asa
versifier. He saw that for this ceremonial occasion simplicity and dig-
nity were of chief importance. Any just appreciation of the poem on
our part must start with the consideration that it was written to be sung
to musical accompaniment by a trained chorus in the open air before a
large body of people. Thus performed it must have been beautiful and
impressive. The ode is carefully polished3 the number of feminine
caesuras is striking. Itis impossible to determine today with accuracy
the way in which the strophes were assigned3 it is probable that the
first, second, and last were sung by the full chorus, and 'it is clear that
vv. 33-34 belong to the boys 35-36 to the girls. Beyond this all is
mere conjecture. For the influence of the Aeneid in this ode, cf. n.
to vv. 37 ff. Metre,69.

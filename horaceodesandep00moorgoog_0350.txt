‘Like a young eagle swooping on his prey or a lion just weaned tear-
ing its first victim, so the Vindelici saw the young Drusus light under
the shadow of the Raetian Alps. Now through defeat they have come
to feel what the noble young NeroS, piously reared beneath Augustus'
roos, can do (1-28). Brave and noble are those who spring from noble
sires. Training is powerless when character falls (29-36). Thy debt,
ORome, to Nero's line is witnessed by the Metaurus, the defeat of
Hasdrubal, and that glorious day when the fearful leader was forced by
the renewed strength of Rome to say “ We are but deer. This people,
tossed to this land from Troy destroyed by fire, gains strength through
loss, grows Hydra-like more strong. No more proud messages shall
lsend to Carthage. All hope was lost when Hasdrubal was killed
( 37 —.”72) Such noble deeds have the Claudii done, no bound' 1s there
to what they yet shall do, with the aid of Jove's favor and mans wise
counsel (73- -76).

This and the fourteenth ode celebrate the victories in 15 amc of
the young Neros, Drusus and Tiberius, stepsons of Augustus. ln the
spring of that year Drusus, then but twenty-three years old, led his
troops up the river Atagis (Adige) and defeated the Vindelician forces
not far from Tridentum (Trent). He then pushed northward across
the Brenner pass and defeated the Breuni and Genauni in the valley of
the river Inn. Tiberius approached from the west by the upper
Rhine and Lake Constance, and the armies under the two brothers
scoured the valleys m which the Rhine and lnn have their sources so
successfully thatin a single campaign the district of the Grisons and
Tirol was completely subjugated and made mto the province Raetia

The occasion of this and the fourteenth ode, as Suetonius tells us
(vz'ta Han), was the ‘command' of Augustus-scripta quidem eius
usque adeo probavit mansuraque perpetua opinatus est, ur non modo
seculare carmen componendum imita-erit scd et Vindelicum ot'ctoriam

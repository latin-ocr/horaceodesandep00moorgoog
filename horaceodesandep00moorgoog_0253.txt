HORATI

visam Britannos hospitibus feros
et laetum equino sanguine Concanum,
visam pharetratos Gelonos
et Scythicum inviolatus amnem.

Vos Caesarem altum, militia simul
fessas cohortis abdidit oppidis,
finire quaerentem labores,
Pierio recreatis antro.

Vos lene consilium et datis et dato
gaudetis, almae. Scimus ut impios

33tt. Britannos: Augustus' pro-
jected expedition against the Brit-
ons may have occasioned their
mention here (cf. introductory n.
to 1, 35), or they may have been
chosen as a type of the peoples
living on the borders of the world.
ef. 1, 35, 30 ultimos orbz's Britan-
nos-hospitibus feros: Tacitus,
Ann. ru„ 30, pictures them as sav-
ages.—Concanum: a Cantabrian
tribe; cf. 2, 6, 2. Verg. G. 3, 463,
says that the Geloni drinlr horses'
blood mixed with milk. Statius,
Achil. 1, 307, attributes a similar
custom to the Massagetae—Gelo·
nos: cs. 2, 9, 233 20, rga—Scythi-
cum amnem: the Tanais, Don. Cf.
3, 10, r.-inviolatus: predicate,-
and still remain rmlzormed.

πῆ. vos: connecting this stro-
phe with the preceding, and bring-
ing us back to the main theme of
this part of the odo-the Muses
and their influence.-altum: ex-
alred-militia simul, etc: after

the battle of Actium Augustus
settled 120,ooo veterans on lands,
spending enormous sums formis
purpose. ln spite of the vexa-
tion that the confiscations of land ,
caused, this disposition of the
troops was doubtless a great relies
to many who seared that the victor
might use his forces to secure ty·
rannical power—abdidit: aptly
expressing the disappearance of
the troops. -finire, etc: Augustus'
great desire seems to have been
forpeace; the Roman world sawa
warrant of this in the disbanding
of his veterans just referred to.—
Pierio recreatis antro: ie. by liter·
ary pursuits in some quiet spot. as
in a cave sacred to the Muses. Cf.

. 1, 12, 6. When Octavian was re-

turning from the East in 29 rac..
he rested some time at Atella in
Campania, where on four succes-
sive days the Georgics, which Ver· ,
gil had just finished, were read to
him by Vergil and Maecenas.

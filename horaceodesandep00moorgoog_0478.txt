HlS WORK is preeminently a student's edition of Caesar's Commentaries
Ton the Gallie War‚ and hasbeen prepared with special reference to the
present needs of preparatory and secondary schools. While it is remark-
able for its simplicity, yet it contains everything which is needed for studying the
author. Attention is called particularly to the following special features of the

book r

1. This edition is furnished withan Introduction containinganoutline
of the life of Caesar, a description in brief of the scenes of his military operations
in Gaul, Germany, and Britain, and a short treatise on the military system
of, the Romans, together with a list of valuable works on subjecta treated in the
Introduction.

2. The text is chiefly that of the critical edition of H. Meusel, Berlin,
1894, now quite generally accepted as the standard. Eacb important chapter
begins with a brief summary in English.

3. The notes are intended to guide the faithful efforts of the student and
to interest him in the stirring events recorded in the Commentarios. Special atten-
tion has been given to the difficult subjects of the subjunctive mood and of the
indirect discourse.

4. The voeabulary gives special attention to etymology, but the treet-
ment is made as simple as possible with the sole aim of aiding the student in
understanding and appreciating thesignificant elements of words. The important
subject of idioms and phrases receives due attention.

5. The illustratione are entirely appropriate and unlike those in most
other works of a similar nature. They have in no instance been introduced merely
for purposes of decoration. Among the most striking features of the work are the
nine colored platee illustrative of the military system of the Romans, which have
been made only after consultation with the highest authorities, and are here repro-
duced in their natural colors. Besides these, there are many other illustrations,
eleven plans of battles, seven campaign maps, arrd a general map of Gaul.

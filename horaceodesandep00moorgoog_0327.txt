3, 28, r] HORATI Ἰ

The festival which occasioned this ode was the Neptunalia, which
fell on July 2 3. The people celebrated it in open air festival, erecting
booths of boughs, called umbrae, 'along the banks oi the Tiber oron the
seashore, sor protection from the sun. Horace, however, represents
himself as on his farm, where he bids his severe housekeeper join him
inacarouse. Metre, 71.

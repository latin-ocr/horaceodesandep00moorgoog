placed at the end of his book the dainty verses, Persicos odi, puer,
apparatus, which picture him at ease and free from care.

The odes os the second book show more reflection, a deeper ’
sense of the poet’s personal relationship to his friends, a more
serious and a graver attitude toward lis . His didactic odes here
lay stres's on wise conduct, and the checking of untoward desires,
rather than on the means os securing enjoyment. The twenty
odes, with two exceptions, are composed in the Alcaic and
Sapphic measures.

ln the third book, Horace appears as the poet os the new Rome
established by Augustus. He shows a conscious pride in his posi-
tion as the priest of the Muses, and his didactic odes have a graver
and severer tone, yet he relieves his serious themes here, as in the
other books, by lighter and charming verses nowhere excelled.
The unity of the entire collection he emphasized by the form of
his epilogue in which he repeats the lesser Asclepiadic measure
used in the opening ode of the first book, but not elsewhere in
the first three books. With proud assurance he claims that by his

⁸ verse he has defeated death itself and won immortal fame.

Α 8. The First Book oi epistles.-With the publication of his
odes, in 23 nc, Horace seems to have felt thathis great work was
done, and for some years he wrote no lyrics3 he did, however, re·
turn to his earlier habit of recording in verse his observations on
life and manners, sermones, which he now presented in the form of
epistles. In some the epistolary lorm is only a cloak, but others
are genuine letters, one a letter os introduction. Some offer a
practical philosophy of lise, others give rules of conduct, still
others celebrate the delights os quiet country life, one is in praise
os wine. The opening letter is to Maecenas and announces Hor-
ace’s intention to abandon poetry and devote himself to philoso-
phy. The collection, twenty epistles in all, was published aster
the middle oi κο nc.

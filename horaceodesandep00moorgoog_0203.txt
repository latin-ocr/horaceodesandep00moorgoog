Horace was nearly killed one day on his farm by a falling tree- lhe
following ode was suggested by this event, which seems to bavemadr
adeep impression on him. (Cf. 2, 17, 27; 3, 4, 27.) Still here lis
very extravagance of earnestness gives the treatment a half jesting tone
After declaring that theman who planted the fatal tree could be guill]
of any crime, Horace wanders into reflection on his favorite theme-
the uncertainty of human life and the proximity of death. On the fot
anniversary of the event, he wrote 3, 8, which fixes the date of his ner·
row escape as March 1, 30 nc. This ode then was probably written
within that month. Mene, 68.

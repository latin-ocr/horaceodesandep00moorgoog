that the Emperor wished to withdraw from the city for a time, as Solon
once had done from AthenS, until the unpopularity of his reform meas·

—he did not come back until 13 Bc. - the feelings of the great body of
citizens were expressed by Horace in this ode. Peace had been so long
ree'stablished that its blessings were evident on every hand, it was
natural that those who remembered the horrors of the civil wars should
have a lively feeling of gratitude to the Emperor who had brought
order out of chaos and had revived the weakened and impoverished
state. To this class Horace belonged, in these verses he shows a
genuine warmth of feeling which is not found in his earlier odes to the
Emperor, and which his official position as laureate did not call forth.
The sense of security here expressed is in marked contrast to the hope·

The ode is carefully polished3 the frequent cases of assonance and
alliteration should be noted. lts date cannot be absolutely determined‚
but may be approximately fixed as 14 me. lt forms a pendant to 4, as

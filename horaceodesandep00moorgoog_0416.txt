With comic pathos and extravagance Horace inveighs against garbe,
declaring that it is worse than all the drugs and poisons known. The
occasion of Horace's indignation seems to have been a fit of indigestion
caused by a salad, of which garlic had been an ingredient, offered him

footing with his patron. The date of composition cannot be more
exactlyfixed. Metre, 74.

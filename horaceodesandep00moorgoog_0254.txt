CARMINA

Titanas immanemque turbam
fulmine sustulerit caduco

qui terram inertem, qui mare temperat
ventosum et urbis regnaque tristia
divosque mortalisque turmas
imperio regit unus aequo.

Magnum illa terrorem intulerat Iovi
fidens iuventus horrida bracchiis,

lene eonsilium, etc. : with reference

αιβάτης κεραυνός ἐκπνέων φλόγα.
-sustuleritz destroyed. The sub·

to Augustus' mild and beneficent jectis the antecedent ofqui in the

policy after he had established his
position (cf. C. S. 51 iacentem lenas
z'nlzostem). This policy of concili·
atlon was in sharp contrast with
the proscriptions of Marius, Sulla,
and also of the second Trium-
virate, consisting· of Antony.
Lepidus, and Octavian, to whose
hatred many fell victims in 43 nc,
among them the orator Marcus
Cicero. - consilium: trisyllabic.
lntr. 39.-dato: sc censilem zsse.
the Muses take delight iu further-
ing the counsel that they have
given-scimus, etc: emphatic, we
all know. Horace thus suddenly
turns to his contemporaries and
reminds them that the lesson is in-
tended for them3 they must recog·
nize that foolish rebellion against
Caesar’s kindly rule is as vain as
the attach of the Titans on Jove's

following verse.

45 ft. terram, mare, urbis, etc:
indicatingtheuniversalityofJove's
rule. Observe also that the natu·
ral contrast of the nouns is height-
ened by the adjectives employed,
-inertem bruta· ventosum, gusty
(cf. 1, 34, 9 bruta tellus et vaga slu-
mina) 3 tristia, glamio, contrasted
with the cities of men. —temperat:
goverus (in harmony). cf. i, 12,
16. lts objects are terram and
mare3 the other nouns denoting
animate creaturas belong with re-
git. —unus: alone, emphasizing the
unity of the world's order.

49ff. The possibility that Jove
should fear the giants is, strictly
taken, inconsistent with his uni-
versal rule described in the preced-
ing strophe; but Horace wished
to exalt (57 f.) the position of Pal-

power.-fulmine . . . caduco: tlte las, the embodiment of wisdom, in

quide-falling holt. So in Aesch. P.
V. 358 ff. it is said that the monster

Typhon was consumed by the κατ-

relation to the power of Jove.

moun—iuventus horrida bracchiis:

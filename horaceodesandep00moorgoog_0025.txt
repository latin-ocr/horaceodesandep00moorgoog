6. The Odes. -The second period of Horace’s literary activity,
29-19 ne, was· devoted chiefly to lyric composition. He had
long been a student of Greek poetry, and the models he now fol-
lowed were chiefly Alcaeus and Sappho (600 nc), whose measures

· he adoptedas his own, and from whose works he drew many themes. ⁴

While these two poets had the greatest influence on him, still, as
the notes to the odes will show, we find evidence of the influence
of Homer, Pindar, Bacchylides, Anacreon, Stesichorus, and the
three tragedians. He drew also from the Alexandrians, but chiefly
from Callimachus and Theocritus. Yet he followed no model
slavishly, and even in his closest studies from the Greek, he made
the themes his own. The earliest odeto which a date can be
assigned with certainty is r, 37, written in 30 inc, on hearing of

the death of Cleopatra. A few may have been written before this,
’ but not many. For seven years Horace gave himself almost ex·
clusively to lyric verse. His mastery of form and language was
now complete, and his developed taste set a high standard of per·
2 fection. The eighty-eight lyrics which belong to this period were
³ never equaled in variety and perfectiori among the Romam, and
alone would entitle their author to the immortality he has enjoyed.
Many of these odes—Horace called them simply carmina,-
especially those addressed to friends were privately circulated
before they were collected into the present three books 3 these
were published in 23 tae, as is clear from iuternal evidence.¹

lThe young Marcellus died at the end of 23 nc, but it is hardly probable
that Horace would have published the reference to him in 1, 12, 45 f. in its
present form after his death; further, in 2.1o(and possibly 3, 19), Horace
mentions Licinius Murena, the brother-inlaw of Maecenas, who was involved
in a conspiracy against Augustus in the latter half of 23 nc, The publication
must have been earlier than the discovery of this plot. The latest reference
is to the death of Quintilius Varus in 1, 24, which Hieronymus records in 23
B.C.; and it is probable that 1, 4, in which L. Sestius is addressed, was written
about July, 23 ue, when Sestius entered on his office as consul suffectus.

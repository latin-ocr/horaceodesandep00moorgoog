governor of Gaul he founded Lugdunum (Lyons) and Augusta Raura-
corum (Augst near Basel); he was later the friend of Antony and was
intrusted by him with the government of Asia and Syria, but Antony's
relations with Cleopatra drove him in 31 ac. to take sides with Octa·
vian. It was he who proposed in January, 27 13.c., that Octavian be
given the title Augustus. Of Horace’s relations to him we know noth-
ing beyond what this ode tells us, and as little of the special occasion
for the poem. The date of composition is uncertain, but verses 26 ff.
were hardly written before 29 B.c., for they seem to show acquaintance
with Verg. Α. 1, 195 ff. Metre, 77.

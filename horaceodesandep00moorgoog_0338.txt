Ten years after the publication of what he had regarded as the
definitive edition of his lyric poems, Horace gathered into a fourth
book some occasional odes written at the request of Augustus, and cer-
tain other poems. See Intr. 9. At the head of the collection he
placed some light verses reminiscent of his earlier service as a poet of
love, and intended to remind the reader that this was still his proper
field. ln these verses he protests that at fifty his days of love are over,
and that Venus should spare him. Young Paulus Maximus, the noble,
comely, and eloquent, will do the goddess larger service and pay her
greater honor. For himself, he no longer finds delight in maid or boy,
in hope for love returned, in sport with wine and flowers. And yet,
what means this tear!

The unexpected turn at v. 33 is similar to that in 3, 26, 11 f. Paulus
Maximus is introduced by' Horace, partly to compliment his young
friend, and partly to secure a foil for himself and his ten lustra. The
ode was probably written but a short time before the publication of
the book, tle. about 14-13 rac. Metre, 71.

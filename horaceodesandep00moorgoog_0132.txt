A lament on the deathflof Quintilius Varus, the common friend of
Horace and of Vergil. He was an accomplished and, according to
Horace's words, Epist. 2, 3, 438 ff, an impartial critic, whose judgment
was valued by his literary friends, Quintilio siquid rectiores, ‘corrige
sodes l leoe' or'elol ‘el leuel ortelius le posse negares, Ι bis terque exper-
lnrn frustra, delere iubebat Ι el rrrale tornatos incudi reddere versus,
The year of his death is fixed by st. Jerome's eutry against 24 nc.
Quintilius Cremonensis Vergili el Horati forrn'leorn moritur. This
ode must have been written within the next few months. The Varus
of the eighteenth ode is probably identical with Quintilius. Metre, 72.

Augustus in the first place, and published the three about 13 ac.
This third epistle is of uncertain date, but probably written about
19-17 ue. It is a didactic treatise on the art of poetry, but deals
chiefly with dramatic poetry, and with the qualifications - genius
and hard work—essential for the poet. The common name, Ars
Portica (or De Arte Portica liber), in all probability was not given
it by Horace, but became attached to it before Quintilian’s day.
By Hadrian’s time the epistle had become separated from the two
with which it was originally published, and formed the tenth book
in an edition of which the four books of Odes, with the Carmen
Saeculare, the Epodes, the two books of Satires, and two of Epar-
tles were the first nine. In the Mss. it regularly follows the Odes,·
H. Stephanus in the sixteenth century restored it to its original ι
position.

12. last Years and Death. -Of the last years of Horace’s life
we know nothing. Maecenas died in the spring of 8 o.c.; his
dying charge to the Emperor, Horati Flacci ut mei esto memor,
bears witness to the unbroken friendship between the two men.
Horace survived his patron but a few months, dying after a brief
sickness at the close of the same year. He was buried near the
tomb of Maecenas on the Esquiline.

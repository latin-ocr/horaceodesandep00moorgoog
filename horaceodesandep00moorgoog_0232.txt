LIBER TERTIVS

THE first six odes of this book, addressed to all patriotic citizens are
distinguished by a unity of purpose and a seriousness of tone not found
elsewhere in Horace. The fact that all are in the Alcaic measure also
contrasts them with other groups of his lyric poems, and proves that he
has a particular purpose in mind: he wishes to show that mere riches
and power are vain3 that only by a return to the stern virtues and simple
habits of an earlier day can Rome regain her greatness3 and that the
present disregard of religion and of domestic virtue is the gravest dan-
ger that threatens the future. It is remarkable that after expressing in
the third and fourth odes confidente in Caesar's rule and the permanence
of the Roman State, Horace closes his sixth ode with gloomy forebod·
ings-‘each generationis worse than the last, and our children will be
baser than we) The most probable explanation of this is that the sixth
ode was written while Horace felt a certain despair for the future; in
arranging his lyrics for publication he let these expressions stand, in the
hope that they might rouse his audience by their very gloom.

The unity of the six is so marked that Porphyrio regarded them asa
single ode—multzfflex (ᾠδὴ) per varos deducta est sensus. Yet the
entire collection was probably not written at the same time. The sixth
ode is apparently the earliest, composed after Octavian's acceptance of
the censorial power (28 B.c.); the third was written after January, 27
ne„ as the· name Augustus (v. 11) shows3 and the mention of the pro-
jected conquest of Britain in the fourth and fifth seems to refer them to
27-26 mc.

The opening strophe of the first ode serves as introduction to the
'entire group. In exalted tone Hora'ce announces that he, as sacred
priest of the Muses, will sing to the rising generations the Muses' teach-
ings in strains never heard before. He then shows that the powerful
and the rich are alike subject to N ecessity's impartial mle (5-16). ‘Lux-
ury will not bring gentle sleep3 only they whose wants are few have
easy spirits3 the great owner cannot escape Fear, Threats‚ and black

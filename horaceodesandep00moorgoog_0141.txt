r, 28, 1] HORATI

shore addresses Archytas (1-6)‚ who in spite of all his wisdom‚ which
enabled him to measure heaven and number the very sands, now lies
under a little earth; this leads the shade to moralize on the universality
of death, which comes to all without distinction (7-22). The last two
verses of this part close the illustrations with the speaker's persoual ex·
perience in the true Horatian manner. ln the second part (23-36) the
spirit appeals to a passing sailor to throw a little dust ou its un'buried
body, that it may find rest in Hades.

Archytas was a statesman, general, and philosopher of Tarentum3
according to tradition a friend of Plato. As a member of the Pythago
rean school he tried to explain the physical universe by mathematics.

16, ι] HORATI

for the state, which doubtless seemed to many to he sinking into ruin.
The differente between his feelings now and a few years later can be
seen from the words C. 1, 14, 17 f. nuper sollicitum quae (sc. naen
= ciuitas) miti taccitum, Ι nunc desiderium curaque nen levo. Sellar
(p. 122) has acutely observed that Horace seems to express the feelings
of the losing side before the peace of Brundisium3 Vergil, in his fourth
eclogue, those of the winning side after its conclusion. The poenis
not only the earliest, but the best of Horace's political verses. There
is an intensity of feeling and a patriotic enthusiasm that did not appear
later when the poet's anxieties had been calmed and somewhat blunted.
In form also it is the most perfect of the epodes. Elision is wholly
avoided in the hexameters-a new effect in Latin verse-and there
are only three cases in the iambics. F urthermore there is a careful
regard for assonance and a skillful use of alliteration that combine with
other excellencies to make this one of the most remarkable productioris
of the Latin poets. The epode has been a favorite wrt th many.

The mention of the Fortunate lsles may be due to the belief that
Sertorius, after his defeat, wished to settle there. Cf. Plut. Sert. 9.
The Scholiast says on v. 42 ed quas (msul as fortunas) Sallustius en
tu'storia dicit vietum voluisse ire Sertorium. Probably the Canaries were
meant. lt is not impossible that some of the party defeated at Philippi
had conceived the same plan. The thought running through the entire
epode is that the state is hopelessly distracted by internal strife3 it
cannot escape min. Therefore all who are earnest and strenuous should

settle in a new land where life can begin auew. The poem should be
compared with Epod. 7 and with Vergil's E. 4. Mene, 76.

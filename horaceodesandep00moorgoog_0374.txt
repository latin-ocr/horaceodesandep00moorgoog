CARMINA

nec, si quid olim lusit Anacreon,
delevit aetas3 spirat adhuc amor
vivuntque commissi calores
Aeoliae fidibus puellae.

Non sola comptos arsit adulteri
¹crinis et aurum vestibus inlitum
¹5 mirata regalisque cultus
et comites Helene Lacaena,

him thus: Stesichorus quamsit
⁷ ingenia validus materiae qnoque
ostendunt, maxima bella et cla-
rissimos canentem dracas et epiri
carminis onera lyra sustinentem.
The last clause explains Horace's
adjective graves.

9. lusit: of light themes, in
contrast to the seriousness of Stesi-
chorus and the passion of Sappho.
With this use of the word, cf. 1, 32,
2. —Anacreonz a native of Teos,
who flourished in the second half
of the sixth century rac. He re·
sided at the court of Polycrates,
tyrant of Samos, and later at that
of Hipparchus in Athens. The·
extant collection of poems called
Anacreontea are, however, of
Alexandrian origin.

10 n. spirat . . . vivunt: cf.
n. to 4, 8, 14.-c0mmissi: with
amor and calores alike. The se·
crets of her love she intrusted to
her lyre. Cf. S. 2, 1, 30 ill (Ln-
cilius) velut fidis arcana sodali·

cf. 2, 13, 24 and n.

13 r. Horace now takes up the

more general aspect os his theme.
All his illustrations are from
Homer. Notice the variety of ex-
pression and the cadence of the
rhythm-comptos . . . crines:
smootlt locks,· the common object
of arsit, blaeed wille lave'sfire, and
mirata, laaked an welle wandering
admiration. The latter continues
with the three following accusa·
tiveS, while arsit is forgotten.
With this description of Paris, cf.
r, 15,‘13 ff. and n.-inlitum:
‘smeared on,' the word is chosen
to emphasize the barbaric magnifi-
cence of Paris and his train—
cultus: dress,¹ cf. 1, 8, 16.—La·
caena: the epithetis added in the
epicfashion. Horacefoundmodels
in the Greek writers for this ac-
count of the effect produced on
Helen’s mind by the appearance
of Paris. Cf. ag. Eurip. Troad.
991 f. ὃν εἰσιδοῦσα βαρβάροις
ἐσθήμασι l χρυσῷ τε λαμπρὸν ἕξε-

μαργώθης φρένας. ‘'At sight of ·

whom, brilliant in his barbarian
dress and gold, thou lost thy
senses.'

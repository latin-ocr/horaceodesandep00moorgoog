EPODON LIBER

libidinosus immolabitur caper

et agna Tempestatibus.
23 f. Horace mockingly closes chosen as a fit offering for relief
with the promise of a solemn from an olens Mevius. With the
sacrifice of thanksgiving for the sacrifice of a lamb to the stonns,

storrn that shall drown Mevius. cf. Verg. Α. 5, 772 Tempestatibus
The libidinosus caper is clearly, agnam caedere deinde iubet.

Horace no longer finds any pleasure in writing verses, ior love once

more has him in his meshes (1-4). Two years have passed since he .

freed himself from Inachia, who long charmed and tortured him (5-22);
now he is ensnared by the fair Lyciscus (23-28). The Pettius to whom

these verses are addressed is otherwise unknown to us. The names ·

Inachia and Lyciscus are borrowed from the Greek. Metre, 80.

Petti, nihil me sicut antea iuvat

scribere versiculos amore percussum gravi,
amore qui me praeter omnis expetit

mollibus in pueris aut in puellis urere.
Hic tertius December, ex quo destiti

Inachia furere, silvis honorem decutit.
Heu me, per urbem (nam pudet tanti mali)

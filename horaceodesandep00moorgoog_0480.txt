This work is designed as a text-book ior the use oi
students in Universities and Colleges, and also to iurnish

an account of this branch of archaeological study ior

equipment oi a teacher oi the classics, and that the sub-
ject itseli has become so important as to justiiy its intro·
duchon, in elementary form at least, into the curriculum
of undergraduate studies. ’

Α distinctive feature oi the book is the number and
character oi its illustrations‚—there being over seven
hundred cuts and diagrams oi inscriptions ior the pur·
pose oi illustrating the text, and for practice in reading.
Of these, over one hundred are photographic repro·
ductions, showing the forms oi the letters and the
arrangement oi the inscriptions. The work is also sup-
plied with an exhaustive bibliography and valuable tables
oi abbreviations, archaismS‚ etc.

An attack on a scurrilous defamer, who like a cowardly cur dared to
assail only those who could not tight in return. ‘Attack me,' says
Horace, ‘and you will find l am ready to bite back. You bark nobly
and then sniff the bone thrown to you (1—10). l shall prove a bull
with horns as sharp as the iambi of Archilochus or Hipponax; I am no
boy to cry and not strike back (ιι-16)) The metaphors are only
apparently mixed, for at v. 11 Horace definitely abandons the figure of
the dog.

Who the object of this attack was must remain uncertain. A num·
. ber of Mss. have the inscription r'n Cassium Severum, by which
the early commentators probably meant the orator Cassius Severus,
banished by Augustus on account of his defamatory writings (Tac.
Dial.19; Ann. 1, 273 4, 21). But this Cassius belonged to Ovid's
generation, so that he can hardly be the person meant. All other
goesses are equally futile. The verses may be only an exercise in zarnbi
(Intr. 4). Metre, 74.

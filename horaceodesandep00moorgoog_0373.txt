The M. Lollius addressed was consul 21 a.c.; in 16 uc. he was
defeated by the Sygambri while governor of Belgian Gaul. ln 2 uc.

he was appointed governor of Syria and adviser and tutor of the young
Gaius Caesar. who was then on a mission to Armenia. He died sud-
denly, gossip said by suicide, in the following year. Horace's ode was
probably written soon after Lollius' defeat in 16 B.c., as an apology for
his friend. Strangely enough the very virtues attributed to him here
-honesty and rectitude —are the ones denied him by Velleius (2, 97:
cf. Plin. Ν. H. 9, 58), who charges him with avarice and venality in

type Εῑιεὸῖἐξ Which account is nearer the truth we cannot determine.

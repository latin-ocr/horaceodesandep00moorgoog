HORATI

nos nequiores, mox daturos
progeniem vitiosiorem.

pression by which Horace has de· ποντο Ι χειροτέρην, ὑμεῖς δὲ κακόν
scribed the moral decay of four gen· τερα reicienda—peior avis: worse
erations in three verses. Aratus, than that os our grandparents.
Phaen. 123 f. was less successful, -mox daturos: destined soon to
οἴην χρυσείην πατέρες γενέην ε’λί· produce.

The unbroken serious strain of the national odes is relieved by these
light verses addressed to Asterie, whose lover is kept from home by
opposing winds. The names are Greek, but the setting is Roman.

‘Why dost thou weep, Asterie, for thy lover, detained by winter
winds across the sea? Be assured that he is faithful, and ever turns a
deaf ear to the messages of his love-loru hostess, who would tempt
him to her. F ear not for him, but see that thou remain thyself as
“ true. Yield not to the charms of thy handsome neighbor: do not listen
to his serenade.'

There is no indication of the date. Metre, 73.

Quid fles, Asterie, quem tibi candidi
primo restituent vere Favonii
Thyna merce beatum,
constantis iuvenem fide,

5 Gygen? Ille Notis actus ad Oricum
post insana Caprae sidera frigidas
noctis non sine multis
insomnis lacrimis agit.

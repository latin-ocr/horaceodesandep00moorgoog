CARMlNA

gaudes carminibus; carmina possumus

donare et pretium dicere muneri.

Non incisa notis marmora publicis,

per quae spiritus et vita redit bonis

post mortem ducibus, non celeres fugae
reiectaeque retrorsum Hannibalis minae,
non incendia Carthaginis impiae

Censorinus is rich enough to buy
these rare things if he desired,
buris too simple in his tastes to
wish them-deliciarum: curtos,
with disparaging force.

11. Horace will bring a gift
which will please his friend, but
such as money cannot buy.

12. pretium dicere muneri: tell
tlte worth of, set a price on. The
common expression is pretinm
statuere, ponere. The following
verses state the worth. The thought
is the same as in Epist. 2, 1, 248 ff.

13ff. ‘Neitherinscribedstatues
nor great deeds in war have se-
cured Scipio the fame which he
has gained from Ennius* poem) -
notis . . . publicis: inscriptions
cnt at tlte state's orders3 instru-
mental abl-marmora: the fol·
lowing clause shows that this in-
cludes both the statues and their
bases on which the inscriptions
are engraved. Translate simply,
nrnrbles. —spiritus et vita: a
double expression ol a single idea,
yet somewhat more comprehen-
sive than either word would be
alone; cf. 4, 2, 28 nnnc rnodoque.
Also with the general sentiment,

cf. Verg. Α. 6, 847 f. excudent alii

spirantia mollius aera, [credo equi·
dem, vinos ducent de marmore
voltus. —- non fugae, reiectae minae,
incendia: all these confer tame,
and might secure the memory of
the leader under whom they were
accomplished; yet all are inferior
to song-fugae: from Italy or
after the battle of Zama, or both.
-reiectae . . . minae: Hanni-
bal's threats against Rome were
hurled back by the reduction ol
Carthage.— incendia, etc: this
verse has troubled critics, both
because it has no diaeresis and
because the burning of Carthage
was not accomplished until 146
a.c., when the Scipio who brought
the Second Punic war toan end
had been dead for seventeen,
and Ennius, who celebrated his
fame, for five years. It was the
younger Scipio Aemilianus who
razed Carthage. However, Hor·
ace may have consciously taken
the name Scipio Africanus—in-
herited by the younger—simply
as typical of one who had won
great fame in war. Yet vv. 18 f.
can strictly only apply to the elder
Scipio.
-impiaez ci. n. to 4, 4, 46.

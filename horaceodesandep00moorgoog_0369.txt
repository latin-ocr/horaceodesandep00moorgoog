The two following odes treat a single theme—the immortality of song.

‘Bronzes, marbles, pictures l have none to give, good friend Censo-
rinus, nor wouldst thou desire thern. Song is thy delight, and song l

C. Marcius Censorinus, cos. 8 B.c., is known only from these verses
and a single reference in Velleius. It has been conjectured not without
reason that this ode was Horace's gift to his friend on the Calends of
March or on the Saturnalia, when presents were exchanged as at our
Christmas. Metre, 53.

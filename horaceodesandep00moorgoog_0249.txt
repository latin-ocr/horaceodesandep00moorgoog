69 n. non hoc, etc: Horace that all has not yet been said.-
suddenly checlrs his muse with the pervicax: persistent. — tenuare:
warning that his lyre is iocosa and to lessen, dwarf. Cf. 1, 6, 12 de·
not suited to such serious themes. terrra· 1, 6, 9 aec . . . conamur,
The strophe is amere device to tenues grandia. Also Prop.4,1,
close the ode. cf. 2, 1, 37 ff. 5dicita, qao pariter carmen tenu·
-conveniet: the tense implies artis in antro?

Horace begins this ode with a second invocation to the Muses and a
renewed pledge of his loyalty and devotion to them. lt was they who
gave him safe escape at Philippi, protected him from the falling trec,
and rescued him from drowning. Under their guardianship he may
wander all unharmed among savage tribes on the very outskirts of the
world (1-36). lt is also they who protect mighty Caesar and aid him
with gentle cnunsel (37-42)· At this point in the ode Horace turns
with apparent abruptness to the story of the giants' defeat in their
battle with the gods, and closes with a warning against, dependence on
brute force and violence (42-80). No Roman, however, would fail to
see that Horace wished to present Augustus here as the vice-regent ot
Jove, and that the powers of violence are those ol rebellion against the
emperor's moderate and beneficent rule. ln the next ode the compari·
son is more outspolren.

The date of composition is approximately 26 u.c.; cf. n. to v. 33.
Metre, 68.

Descende caelo et dic age tibia

Muses dwell on Olympus, Il. 2, ‘Come back to earth from the
484 Μοῦσαι Ὀλύμπια δώματ’ ἔχου· council of the gods (in the pre·
σαι. The ancient commentatore ceding ode).' This is possible.

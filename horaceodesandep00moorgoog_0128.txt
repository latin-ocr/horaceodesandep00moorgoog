‘The upright man is safe, no matter where he roams. Iknow ’

that this is true, friend Fuscus, for once in Sabine wood as 1 sang of
Lalage, a monster wolf lled from me, though l was unarmed. Put me
in chill northern gloom or beneath the torrid sun, still will l ever sing
my Lalage'

The affected solemnity of the first two strophes has often led com-
· mentators to interpret this ode too seriously‚ as if Horace were sol-
emnly preaching a moral lesson. While an actual encounter witha
wolf may have furnished the opportunity for the illustration‚ Horace
was the last man to use such an event to point a moral, still less take
himself for an example of the noblest virtue. He never preacheS, and
is always free lrom cant. As a matter of fact, the ode is a piece of
humor which Horace knew his friend Aristius Fuscus would appre-
ciate. No doubt Horace had had many proofs of Fuscus’ fondness
for joking; he tells of one occasion (S. 1, 9, 61-73) when his friend
refused to rescue him from a bore. The relations between the two
were the closest. Cf. Epist. 1, 10, 3f. paene gemelli fraternis aniani.
Metre, 69.

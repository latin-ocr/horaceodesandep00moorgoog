cantemus Augusti tropaea
Caesaris et rigidum Niphaten

Medumque flumen gentibus additum
victis minores volvere vertices,
intraque praescriptum Gelonos
· exiguis equitare campis.

tropaea as a general term, defined
by what follows-Niphaten, lhe-
dumflumen. . . volvere, Gelonos . . .
equitare. It is probable‚ however,
that Horace had no definite victo·
ries in mind, but wished to say,
‘Come Valgius, let us turn to epic
song3 our subject is ready—Au-
gustus' new successes (in general)
and (in particular) the Niphates,'
etc.

20 ff. These were victories oi
diplomacy rather than of arms.—
rigidum: iudom-Niphaten:
according to Strabo and Dio Cas·
sius, a mountain of Armenia. But
Lucan3,245andSil.Ital.13‚765and
Iuv. 6, 409 consider itariver. Verg.
G. 3, 30 celebrates the same exten-
sion of the empire‚ addam urbes
Asiae domitas pulsumque Nipha-
teu.—Medum flumen: the Euphra-
tes. The construction changes
lrorn the simple accusative to the
accusative and infinitive, ‘sing the

Niphates, sing that,' etc. Proper·
tius has a similar construction, 2,
1, 19ff. uon ego Titanas canerem,
uau Ossan Olympo! aitpositam, ut
caeli Pelian esset iter! . . .Xerut's
et emperia biua cause vada.—mi·
nores: in tolren ol its submission.
Cf. Verg. Α. 8, 726 Euphrates z‘bat
iam uralliar undis.

23. Gelonos: anomad Scythian
people on the river Don. The
poets of this time, however, use
their name sor the Scythians in
general-exiguis: for they are
now limited intra praescriptum.-
equitare: ride their raids. cf. 1,
2, 51. The reference in the last
two verses is probably to an ern-
bassy frorn the Scythians which
Augustus received at Tarraco in
Spain. Cf.Mau. Aue. 5, 51 uestram
amiu'tiam petierunt per legatas
Bastarnae Scythaeque et Sarma-
tarum quisunt eitra flumen Τ a·
naim et ultra reges.

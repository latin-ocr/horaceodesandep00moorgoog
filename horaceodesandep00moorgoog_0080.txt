‘Varius, who vies with Homer, shall sing thy exploits, Agrippa.
The deeds 01 heroes and tragic themes are all too great 101 my weak
powers; Iwill not detract from Caesar's fame and thine. Only wine
and lovers' quarrels are suited to my verse'

Addressed to Μ. Vipsanius Agrippa, Augustus' ‘Minister 01 War'
and greatest general ς he defeated Sextus Pompey at Naulochus, 36 B.c.,
and was commender at Actium, 31 nc. Apparently Agrippa, or
Agrippa's friends, had suggested to Horace that he celebrate the gen·
, eral's exploits in verse. This ode is Horace's skillful apology and should
be compared with similar expressions, 2, 123 4, 2, 27ff.; S. 2, 1,12;
Epist. 2, 1, 250 ff. In each case, however, while declaring his unfitness
101 the task, he describes deeds 01 war, yet brieily, not in an elabo-
rate poem. Here by his manner 01 declining, he pays Agrippa the
highest tribute as wellas compliments his friend Varius. The date
01 composition is after 29 ne, when Agrippa returned 110111 the East.
Metre, ‘72.

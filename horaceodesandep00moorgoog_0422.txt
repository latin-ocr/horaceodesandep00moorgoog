The Romans were extremely superstitious, and during the last cen- .

tury of the Republic especially, there was arapid increase in the num· ⁸

ber of people among them who professed to practice the magic arts.
The efficacy of witchcraft and love potions was not doubted by the mass
of the people. ln this epode Horace pictures four hags, of whom Cani·
dia is the chief, in the act of preparing one of their most potent charms
by which Canidia hopes to win back the affections of her aged lover.
The quartette have captured a boy whom they propose to bury to the
chin in the atrium of Canidia's house, that he may starve. His death is
to be made the 'more painful by the sight of food frequently renewed,
that his longing for it may sink into his liver and very marrow, which
' then shall be used for the irresistible philter. lt is not impossible that
children were occasionally murdered for such purposes3 at any rate
there was a current belief that such atrocities were practiced, as the
Chinese are said to believe to-day that the missionaries kill young chil-
dren to obtain the ingredients for certain charms. Cicero charges
Vatinius, in Vetin. 14 curn inaudite ac nefaria saera susceperis, cum
inferorum arietes elicere, eum puerorum eriri dees errares eiectare
soleas, etc. The following inscription, found in a columbarium on the
Esquiline, is also important testimony. CIL. 6, 19, 747 lucendus Liviae
Drusi Caesaris f(ilius) Gryphi et Vitellis. In quartum surgens cerer-
prensus deprimor annum, 1 cum possem matri dulcis et esse petri. 1
eripuit me saga ritanus crudelis ubique, 1 crem enaret in terris et nocet
arte sua. 1 ves vestros natos concustodite parentes, 1 rei dolor in tete
pectere fixsres eat.

Commentators have been much puzzled as to the identity of this
Canidia, whom Horace mentions in two other epodes (3 and 17) and
in S. 1, 8. Porphyrio says that she was a certain Gratidia from Naples,

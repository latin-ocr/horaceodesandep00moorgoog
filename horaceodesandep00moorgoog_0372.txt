CARMINA

Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori ;
caelo Musa beat. Sic lovis interest
optatis epulis impiger Hercules
clarum Tyndaridae sidus ab infimis
quassas eripiunt aequoribus ratis,
ornatus viridi tempora pampino

The first hals of this ode continues the theme of the preceding but
with a somewhat different turn. The remainder is in praise of M.
Lollius.

‘Do not despise my lyric Muse. Though Homer with his epic verse
holds the supreme place, the verses of the lyric bards of Greece are not
thereby obscured. Homer's Helen was not the first to love3 nor his
Troy the only city vexed; his heroes not the only ones to fight for
wives and children dear, yet the others are unwept because unsung (1-
28). My verse shall save thy deeds from oblivion's doom. For thou
art wise, firm, upright; not consul fora single year, but victor, ruler
over all (29-44). Truly fortunate is that man who wisely uses what
the gods bestoW, fears not small estate, and does not shrink from death
for friend or native land (45-52).’

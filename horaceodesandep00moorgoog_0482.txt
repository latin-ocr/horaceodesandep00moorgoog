This work gives a representative survey oi Latin Lit-
erature, intended to be read in advanced academie or
college work, as supplementary to a regular course in
Latin Literature, or to be itself the fundamental work
in such a course. The selections range lrom the popular
songs which antedate written literature, to the Christian
hymns of the third century, covering the early dramatists,
historiens, orators, philosophers, the writers of satire and
epigram, the lyrie and epie poets‚ the collectors of anec-
dotes‚ letter writers, and authors ol prose works, and
including other material of a popular nature, such as
lampoons‚ parodies, epitaphS, advertisements, announce-
ments ol ball games, theatrical and gladiatorial noticeS,
ete. To each selection' is prefixed a concise account ol
the author, when known, and of his works, with a brief
bibliography. For convenience in sight reading the text
is provided with a translation of the more difficult wordS,
and is followed bya fuller commentary on special points
of interest.

CARMINA [2, 17, 30

utrumque nostrum incredibili modo
consentit astrum: te Iovis impio
tutela Saturno refulgens
eripuit volucrisque fati

tardavit alas, curn populus frequens
laetum theatris ter crepuit sonum;
me truncus inlapsus cerebro

21 ff. utrumque, etc: cf. n.t0 v. locative abl-ter: a stock num·
8above.-consentit: the passage ber. Cf. Prop. 4, 9, 4 Camenae
is imitated by Persius 5, 45 f. nou . . . manibusfaustos ter crepuere
equidem hec dubites, amborum soreos.
foedere certo l consentire dies et 27 f. me truncus, etc.: cf. 2,
abnuo sidere duca-te: the con· 13.-sustulerat: the indicative
trasted me follows v. 27. ‘Thou emphasizes the certainty of Hor-
art under the protection of supreme ace's fate which was suddenly

Jove) Possibly in Maecenas'
horoscope Jupiter was in the as·
cendant-impio . .. Saturno:
connect with both refulgens and
eripuit. According to the as-
trology of the time Saturn's influ-
ence was baneful. Cf. Prop. 5, 1,
84 grave Saturni sidus in omne
caprei,¹ and our ⁴ jovial’ and ‘sat-
urnine.’-refulgens: sterling out
against. Jupiter offsets Saturn's
power to harm.

here equivalent to martti. Cf. S.
2, 1, 58 seu mors atris circumvo-
letalis.

25 f. cum . . . crepuit: the
date was 30 ac. For the occa·
sion, see n. to 1, 20, 4.—theatris:

averted by Faunus. Cf. 3, 16, 3.
28 f. Faunus: the kindly wood-
land spirit, who loved to visit
Horace's farm and to care for his
flocks (1, 17), is named here as
protector. The Muses hold this
position 3, 4, 273 Liber 3, 8, 7. -
Mercurialium, eto: Mercury as
god of speech and inventor of the
lyre (3, 11, 1 ff.) is here made the
guardian of poets. Ordinarily the
phrase means the devotees of Mer-
cury, the god of gain, as S. 2, 3,
24 f. laertes egregiusque domm
mercarier unus lcum lucre noram:
unde frequentia Mercuriale Ι iu·
posuere milei cognomen competa.
30· reddere: to pay, because
the offering vowed is due the gods.

Cicero’s defense oi old age is so charming in style and
so interesting in matter that it deserves something more
⁸by way oi commentary than mere discussion of gram-
matical and linguistic usage. Accordingly an attempt has
been made in the illustrative notes, on the pages with
the text, to give prominence to the historical and
literary features of the essay, and to show by numerous
quotations what ancient and modern authors have uttered
like thoughtS, couched in similar forms of expression.

In order that the chief emphasis may be placed on the
literary clement, the grammatical and textual commentary
is placed in a separate body of notes following the text.
The commentaries are supplemented bya list of variations
from the text of Mulier, an index t0 the notes, and an
index of proper names.

The text is preceded by an introduction containing a
life of Cicero, a resume of his workS,a valuable bibli-
ography, and a discussion, analysis, and summary of the

Dc Senectute.

Copies of Cicero's Cato Maior De Senectute will be sent, prepaid, to any

ln an allegory Horace prophesies his own immortality. He is not to
die, but shall be transformed into a swan and fly from the Stygian wave
to the confines of the world. His description oi the change which he
ieels coming on him is given in such detail (9-12) as to rob the poem, ior
the modern reader at least, of much os the charm that it would otherwise
possess. The identification of the poet's song with the flight of a bird
was common in antiquity‚ as it is to-day. cf.eg1he0g.237ff, 1097 f.;
Pind. Ν. 6, 47 ff.; Eurip. Frg. 911 N.; Theoc. 7, 47.

Apparently Horace wrote this ode alter his collection in three books
was practically complete, intending it as an epilogue to his lyric verse.
F ortunately his second attempt, which now stands at the end of the third
book, was iar superior, so that he relegated these verses to their present
position. Metre, 68. ·

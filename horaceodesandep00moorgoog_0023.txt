forms a refrain (epodus, ἐπῳδός) to the first. In this he was a
conscious imitator of Archilochus, who, in the seventh century rae„
had perfected this form in iambic measure, and used it as the
sharpest weapon of personal attack. The name which Horace,
following Archilochus, gave his verses —iambi-can apply prop·
erly to only the first ten of the seventeen in the present collection.
Τ he remaining seven are in different measures, bat only one, the
seventeenth, lacks the epodic form 3 so that in time the name
Epades drove out Horace's designation. While Horace shows
himself equalto his model inform, he exhibits little of the passion
ascribed to Archilochus. Eight epodes show the invective spirit,
two exhibit a coarseness of thought and expression which does
not appear later, but others have nothing aggressive in them.
The first, for example, is a plea to be allowed to accompany Mae·
cenas to Actium, the ninth is a song of joy over the victory gained
there; the seventh and sixteenth deal with the conditions of the
state, the second isan idyl on the joys of country life3 and the
others have little of the invective spirit. They were written at
various times between 40 and 31 e.c.; the sixteenth is probably
to be referred to the earlier date, and the ninth is later than the
battle of Aetium, Sept. a, 31 nc.

5. Horace and Maecenas. —Horace's verses brought him into
notice soon after his return, and gained him the friendship of
Vergil and Varius, who introduced him to Maecenas, apparently ’
in the spring of ‘38n.c. Ninemonths later, in the winter of
38s3713c, Maecenas invited him to join the inner circle of his
friends. From this time Horace was free from material cares ;
and about the year 33 rac. he received from his patron a farm in
the valley of the Digentia, among the Sabine hills, which was
thereafter his favorite home and constant source of happiness.
Maecenas was already at this time the trusted friend and adviser
of ’ Octavian. In 36 rac, when Octavian set out from Rome for
his campaign against Sextus Pompey, and in 31 ac, during the

final struggle with Antony and Cleopatra, Maecenas was left

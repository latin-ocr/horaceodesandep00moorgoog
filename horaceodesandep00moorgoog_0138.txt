CARMINA [1, 27, 6

γ, 27

A dramatic picture of acommatu at which the poet tries to check
his hot companions; when they fill their cups and will make him drink,
he patries their impetuosity by refusing, unless his neighbor tell him the
name of his love. The whispered secret makes him exclaim in pity.

The ode is based on a similar one by Anacreon, according to Por-
phyrio; possibly the one of which Athenaeus (10, 42, 7) has preserved to
us a fragment (Frg. 63) ἄγεδηῦτε μηκέτ’ οὕτω i πατάγῳ τε κᾶλολητῷ1
Σκυθικὴν πόσιν παρ’ οἴνῳ l μελετῶμεν, ἀλλὰ κολοῖς i ὑποπίνοντες ἐν ὕμνοις.
‘Come, now, let us no longer with din and shout practice Scythian drink-
ing at our wine, but sip it while we blithely sing' The exhortatiou to
moderation in the use of wine (1-8) issimiiar to the theme of 1, 18.

After showing in the first ode the vanity of power and richeS, Horace
here takes up a positive theme.

‘Content with small estate the Roman youth should learn courage
in the stern school of war, that he may light for Rome and die for her
if need be3 death sor one's native land is sweet and glorious; and the
coward may not escape the common fate (1-16). True manhood is
secure and independent os popular fav0r; it alone gives immortality
(17-24). F idelity and silence too have their secure reward. The
wicked punishment sooner or later overtakes (25-32).’ Metre, 68.

Angustam amice pauperiem pati
robustus acri militia puer
condiscat, et Parthos ferocis
vexet eques metuendus hasta,

vitamque sub divo et trepidis agat
in rebus; illum ex moenibus hosticis
matrona bellantis tyranni
prospiciens et adulta virgo

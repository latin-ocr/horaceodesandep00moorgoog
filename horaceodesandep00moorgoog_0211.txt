2, 15, ι] HORATI

Such protests are common to all times of wealth and luxury. Another
example is 3, 6. Augustus tried to restrain the growth of private extrave
gance, and to restore the agricultural prosperity of Italy. Some editors
have wished, therefore, to connect this ode with the date (28 mc.) at
which Octavian assumed the duties ol censor, and indeed it is quite pos
sible that it was written at the emperor's request. The verses are still
and bear the marks ol being made to order. The position herealter '
14, from which in some manuscripts it is not separated, is a natural one,
lor it continues the attack on the folly ol great wealth'. The odeis,
however, wholly impersonai, not even the indefinite seoond person being
used, and lacks the poetica] quality ol 14. Metre, 68.

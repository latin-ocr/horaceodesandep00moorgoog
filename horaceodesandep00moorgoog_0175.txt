In the preceding ode Horace expanded a Stoic maxim3 in this he
gives us a similar treatment of a lavorite Epicurean principle, ‘enjoy
life while you may, but never too extravagantly, for death is close at
hand. N either riches nor family can save us irom the common doom'

The Dellius addressed is undoubtedly Q. Dellius, whom Messala
nieknamed desultor bellorum civilium because oi his frequent changes
of allegiance during the civil wars. ln 31 uc. he returned finally to
Octavian's side, and later became one of his trusted courtiers. The
place of the ode here was determined both by the similarity of its sub-
ject with that of 2, and especially by Horace's desire to give Dellius a
place next Sallust. Cf. intr. n. to 2, 1.

The date ol composition cannot be determined, but is clearly later
than the reconciliation between Dellius and Octavianus. Mene, 68.

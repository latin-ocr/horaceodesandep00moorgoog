‘O Goddess, Queen of Antium, who canst exalt or humble. All
court thy favor, the poor man and the prince, the wild Dacian and
Scythian, the sturdy Latin stock, lest thou bring wild discord (1-16).
Fierce Destiny goes before with wedge and clamp (17-20)‚ but Hope

thee, daughter os Zeus the Deliverer, Saving Fortuna, guard wide-ruling
Himera. For at thy beck the swift ships are piloted on the sea,
and on the land fierce wars and council-giving assemblies. The hope·
of men are tossed, often up, but again down, as they cut their
way through the high waves of salsity.' Horace's ode lorms the basis

‘Danae's lot, the ruin of Amphiraus' house, the overthrow of cities
and defeat of rival princes hythe Macedonian‘s bribes, all show the
power of gold to harm (1-16). And gains when made but feed the
greed for more. l have done well, Maecenas, to follow thy example,
and to shun a high estate. The more each man denies himself, the
more the gods bestow. My small farm with its clear stream, its little
wood, and faithful crop, makes me more fortunate than the lord of fer-
tile Africa, though he know it not (17-32). l have no luxuries that is
quite true3 yetl escape the pangs of poverty. And thou wouldst give me
more ifI should wish. No, n03 increase of income l shall best attain
by lessening my desires. Happy is that man on whom God has be·
stowed little and enough (33—44).' Ι

This ode thus treats Horace's favorite theme: the powerlessness of
wealth to secure happiness, the value of a spirit content with little.
lt should be compared with 2, 2, and 16, and for Horace's personal
desires with 1, 31; 2, 18. There is no indication of the date of com·
position. Metre, 72.

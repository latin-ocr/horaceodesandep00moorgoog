HORATI

Saturni veteris; tuque pedestribus

dices historiis proelia Caesaris,

Maecenas, melius ductaque per vias
regum colla minacium.

Me dulcis dominae Musa Licymniae

cantus, me voluit dicere lucidum

fulgentis oculos, et bene mutuis
fidum pectus amoribus;

quam nec ferre pedem dedecuit choris
nec certare ioco nec dare bracchia ’

91. tuque: emphatically intro·
ducing the specific reason why
Horace cannot celebrate Caesar's
deedS,— ‘And then you will tell,'
etc-pedestribus . . . historiis:
prose, in contrast to poetry. Hor-
ace was the first to adopt this term,
in imitation of the Greek πεζὸς
λόγος. There is no evidence that

Maecenas ever undertook such a
work as Horace here suggests.
111. ducta: ie. in the trium-
phal procession. - colla: ‘with
chains about their necks.' Cf.
[epod. 7, 7 f. ultactus aret Bruan-
uus ut descenderet l sacra catenu-
tus via, and Prop. 2, 1. 33 s. with
reference likewise to Augustus'
triumphs (canerem) regum uerrutis
cz'rcumdalarolla catenis l Actiaque
iu sacra currere rostra τιία. -mi-
nacium: but just ηοω threateniug.
13. me . . . me: ‘My task is
this) lntr. 3o.-dominae: this
became under the empire the
regular title of address to a mar-

ried woman, like our ‘Mra'
‘Madam‚’ the Italian ‘donna'
Translate, my lady.— Licymnlae:
ancient critics agreed that under
this name Terentia, Maecenas* “
wife, is meant. The lact that the r
two names are metrically identical
makes this very probable. So
Catullus calls clodia, Lesbia; Ti-
bullus employs Delia for Plania,
etc. That Licymnia in any case
was a free-born Roman lady is
proved by v. 19f. See note.-
cantus: modified by dulcia-
bene: connectwithfldnm. CfiCie
T usc. 2, 44 bene ntagnus, and the
French bien. The opposite is
attale: so 1, 17, 25 male dtbpart
Verg. Α. 2, 23 malefida.

171. ferre pedem: to movebar
feet in, etc. Cf. Verg. G. 1, ιι
serre simul Faunique pedem.
Dancing, except as part of a
religious ceremony‚ was thought
unbecoming a Roman woman,
although the severityofcustomwaa

ln the prologue to the three books ol odes Horace expresses the
modest hope that Maecenas will count him a lyric poet; in the epi·
logne, he triumphantly declares that he has built a monument of verse
that will outlast bronze and unnumbered time itself. He boasts that
his fame shall grow when heis dead, and that so long as Rome shall
last, men shall say that he was the first to transplant Aeolian verse to
Italy. So let the Muse place the laurel crown upon his brow.

lt is little wonder that when Horace surveyed the substantial body
of lyric verse which he was about to intnrst to the world, he felt a nat·
ural pride in his accomplishment. This feeling was undoubtedly in-
creased by the thought of his humble origin and by the memory of his
early struggles for recognition and of the envious scorn he had aroused
among the noble poetasters of his day. Ol this last, however, there is
no hint in this ode. Horace now knew that his fame was secure. He
was the first Roman to write a large amount of lyric poetry‚ and his
odes had already received the lavorable judgment of the best critics in
Rome. -Il to our modern laste he seems too frank in expression, we
must remember that antiquity apparently took no such offense, sor he
had many predecessors, and later poets did not hesitate to speak with
equal boldness. Metre. only 1, 1 and here, 53.

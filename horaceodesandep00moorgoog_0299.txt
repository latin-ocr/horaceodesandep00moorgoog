‘You prate of ancient genealogies and wars, but never a word do you
say on the real questions of the moment-how much we shall pay fora
jar of wine, how, where, aud when we shall drink. Come, a toast to
the Moon‚ to the Night, to our friend Murena, the augur. The wine
shall be mixed as your tastes deumnd3 give music, scatter flowers, and
let old Lycus hear our din and envy our light loves.²

Horace thus dramatically portraysa company which has fallen into
serious conversation on mythological subjects, and forgotten the pur·
pose of the gathering. ln the first two strophes he recalls bis compan-
ions from their soberer talk3 then suddenly assuming the character of
magister bi'bendi, he names the toastS, the strength of the wine that
shall be used, and calls for flowers and music. The occasion for the
ode may have been a symposium in Murena's honor (v. 10 f.)‚ but it is
more likely that the poet's imagination gave the impulse for the lines.
They should be compared with C. 1, 27. The date of composition
cannot be determined. Metre, 71.

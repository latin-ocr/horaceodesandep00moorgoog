·Spring is here agaim hand in hand the Nymphsand Graces dance.

The seasons change and wane‚ but come again. But we, when we are
gone, come not back. So give thyself good cheer while yet thou mayst;
thou canst not buy escape from nether gloom.'

The ode is a close parallel to 1, 4, with which it should be carefully
compared. The Torquatus addressed was an intimate of Horace and
an advocate of considerable prominence. See Epat. 1, 5. There is
no hint of the date of composition. Mene, 78.

Diffugere nives, redeunt iam gramina campis
arboribusque comae;
mutat terra vices et decrescentia ripas
flumina praetereunt3
ς Gratia cum Nymphis geminisque sororibus audet '
ducere nuda choros
Immortalia ne speres, monet annus et almum

tiencta serort'bus3 1, 4, 6 iunctae·
que abneptis Gretzee decentes.

‘inner object' of mutat. cf. 1, 4,

7. immortalia: imnrortelity.
—ne speres: dependent on monet:
cf. 1, 18, 7 f. With the senti-
ment, cf. Eurip. Frg. 1075 θνητὸς
γὰρ ὤνκαὶ θνητὰ πείσεσθαι δάκεν
Ι<ἢ> θεοῦ βίον ζῆν ἀξιοῖς ἅνθρω-
πος ὤν; ‘F or as thou art mortal‚

expect to bear a mortal's lot, ·

or dost thou ask to live a god's
life, when thou art but a man?'

been brought into relation with associated ideas. It is therefore
necessary for the student to leam to carry in his mind incomplete
ideas through groups of words of varying length. Such groups are
common to both prose and poetry3 but in prose they are usually
brief, combinations of three words being most frequent, eg. ab
exiguis profecta initt'is, although larger groups are not unknown.
But in poetry the arrangement and grouping of words is much
more highly developed. The following examples illustrate the
more common arrangements in Horace’s lyrics, which the student
must train himself to grasp as units.

19. Groups of three words ε -

1, 1, 1 atavis edite regibus
1, 15, 8 regnum Priami vetus

1, 22, 22 terra domibus negata
2, 5, 12 purpureo varius colore
2, 7, 2 Bruto militiae duce

lt should be notieed that in these groups the first and third

words agree grammatically and inclose the word they modify3
and that the places of adJ'ective and noun are varied at pleasure. In
the following larger groups the relation of the words is shown by
varying type so faras possible.

2ο. Groups of four words may have the following great variety

of arrangement ε -

2, 3, 9 pinus ingens albaque populus

2, 6, 5 Tibur Argoo positum colono

1, 24,9 multis illc bonis flebilis

1, 19, 11 f. vorsis animosum equis 1 Parthum
2, 8, 11 f. gelidoque divos 1 morto carentis

1, 1, 22 ad aquae lenc caput sacrae

1, 12, 22 f. saevio inimica virgo 1 beluis

3, 8, 13 f, cyathos amici 1 sospitis centum

4, 1, 4f. dulcium 1 mater saeva Cupidinum

(a) Often a verb or verbs form part of the group, eg. : -

1, 1, 34 Lesboum rcsugit tendere barbiton
1, 5, 9 te fruitur credulus aurea

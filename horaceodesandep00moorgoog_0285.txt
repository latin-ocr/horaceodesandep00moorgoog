To the spring Bandusia. These exquisite verses may have been
occasioned by the festival of springs, the Fontz'nalia, which fell on
October 133 but the situation of the spring thus immortalized-il
indeed it ever existed outside Horace's fancy- is wholly unknown. Α
document of 1103A.1). mentions a fons Bandusinus near Venusia, but
it is very probable that this is an identification of the Middle Ages
rather than an ancient name. ,Bandusia seenrs to be a corruption of
Πανδασὰα, and may have been given by Horace to the large spring on
his Sabine farm, fons etz'am rivo dare nomen idoneus, Epzst. 1, 16,12.
We need be little concerned, however, with the situation, for the verses
are sufficient in themselves. Metre, 73.

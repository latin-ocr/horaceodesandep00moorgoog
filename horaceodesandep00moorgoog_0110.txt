‘When faithless Paris was carrying Helen home to Troy, Nereus be·
calmed the sea that he might foretell the doom that was to follow Paris'
crime.5 Porphyrio says that the motive was taken from Bacchylides, who
made Cassandra prophesy the coming war and disaster, as Horace here has

Nereus (Porphyrio read Proteus). If Porphyrio be right, Horace’s model ,

has been lost to us; the extant fragment 14 Blass, in whichMenelauswarns
the Trojans to remember the justice of ZeuS, cannot be that to which
Porphyrio refers. The theme is essentially epic and does not properly
fall within the province of lyric poetry3 and Horace has not been very

successful in his treatment of it. While some dramatic skill is shown, ’

the episode chosen has no natural limits and therefore offered him little
opportunity for a climax3 the length of the prephecy was determined
solely by the poet's inclination. That Horace learned to handle narrative
subjects later is proved by Book 3, Odes 11 and 27, with which this ode
should be carefully compared. For Horace's view as to the proper field
for lyric verse, see Book 2, Ode 12.

For the reasons given above and because of the technical defect of
v. 36, we may regard this as one of Horace’s earlier studies. Metre, 72.

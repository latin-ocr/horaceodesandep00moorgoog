HORATI

adponefnec dulcis amores ,
sperne puer neque tu choreas,

donec virenti canities abest

lenesque sub noctem susurri
composita repetantur hora;

nunc et latentis proditor intimo.
gratus puellae risus ab angulo

connected with repetantur, be
claimed ; the opposite of reddere.
cf. n. on reponens, v. 6, above.

until it is complete. Each idea in
the first verse has its complement
in the second: —

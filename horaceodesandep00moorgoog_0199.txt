Maecenas had apparently urged Horace to celebrate in verse Octa·
vian's victory over Antony and his other successes in the East. This
ode is the poet's reply.

‘Not deeds ol war long past (1-4)‚ not ancient mythology (5-8)‚ nor
Caesar's present deeds and triumphs (9-12)‚ but modest love, the charms
os thy Licymnia. are alone fit subjects for my lyric muse (13-28).'

' 4, ι] HORATI

praemium adlecti, qnos arcinas virgus vocabat) ad niodum pristinum
et splendorem redegit duabus lectionibus.

Horace was himself the son of a freedman, but nothing could be
more offensive to him than the straining and display of such parvenus.
His own attitude is clearly seen in S. 1, 6, where his calm tone shows
that he is discussing a general question. The fierceness of this epode
seems to warrant the belief that he has some definite individua} in
mind, who probably was easily recognized by his contemporaries.
All efforts to identify him are useless. Many of the Mss. have
the inscription: ad Sextum Menam libertinum. Vedium Rufum
er servitute miratur usurpasse equestrem dignitatem nsque aa’ tribn-
natnm militnm. The first part refers to Menas, or Menodorus‚ a
freedman of Sextus Pompey who twice deserted to Octavian. The
name Vedius was probably suggested to the earlier commentators bya
passage in Cicero’s letter to Atticus (ad att. 6, 1, 25) which was written
at Laodicea in 54 nc„ but not published until some time in the first
century nn. irae ego en P. Vedio, magna nebulone (russel), sed Pompeii
taneen familiare} audini: iric Vedius venit mim¹ obuiam cnm dnonas
essedis (English gigs) et raeda (carryall) eques iuncta et lectica et
familia magna, pra qna, si Curia legera pertulerit, HS centenas pendat
necesse est; erat praeterea aniciensium dag-headed ape) in esseda
nec deerant onagri (wild asses).· neeereqnam vidi neminem nequiorem.
The possibility remains‚ however, that this epode is nothing more than
an exercise after Archilochus (Intr. 4). The date of compositionis
probably 3613.c. See n. to 17-19. Mene, 74.

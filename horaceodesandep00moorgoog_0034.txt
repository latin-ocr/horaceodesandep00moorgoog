SCHOLIA AND EDITIONS [ξ 15

The work of all these commentators has been lost, save in so
far as it is incorporated in the following scholia : —

(1) The scholia of Pomponius Porphyrio, a grammarian of the
third century apparently, who devoted himself chiefly to gram-
matical and rhetorical interpretation.

(2) The scholia which bear the name of Acro. This collection
was drawn from many sourceS, one of which was Porphyrio, from
whom much was taken. Acro’s name was not attached to these
scholia until the fifteenth century.

(3) The scholia of the commentator Cruquianus. These are
the comments gathered together by Cruquius from many sources,
, and are of slight value.

(c) Editions. —The place and date of the editio pnnceps is
unknown, but 1t was published rn Italy before 1471. Bentley’s edi-
tion in 1711 made anew era in Horatian criticism. Of the modern
critical and explanatory editions, the following are important : -

Keller and Holder, editio maz'or, 2 vols. Leipsic‚ 1864-187o;

vol. 1 (Odes, Epodes, and C. S.) in ad ed. by Keller, Leipsic‚ ⁴

1899, eed'tio minor, 1878. Keller, Epilegomena zu Horon, Leip-
sic‚ 1879—1880, is also important for its collection of variant
readings and discussion of them.

Orelli, 4th ed. by Hirschfelder and Mewes, 2 vols, with Latin
commentary and complete word index, Berlin, 1886, 1892.

Kt’esslt'ng, ad ed., 3 vols. Berlin, 1890-18973 vol. 1 in 3d ed,
1898.

chlzam, Odes and Epodes, 3d ed. Oxford, 1896 3 Satires
and Epistles, 1891.

L. Mdller, Satires and Epz'slles, Leipsic‚ 1891-1893. Odes
and Epodes, 1900.

The scholia are not yet fully available in good editions. Α be·
ginning has been made by Keller and Holder, Porfyn'om's
commentum rec. A. Holder. Innsbruck, 1894. The scholia of
the Commentator Cruquianus are now best printed in Keller and
Holder's large edition, vol. 1, 2d ed, pp. 343-370.

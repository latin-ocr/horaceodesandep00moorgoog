“ Short in stature, prematurely gray, fond ol the sun, quick to
take offense, but readily appeased.” This agrees with the account
given in Suetonius' life, where we are told that the Emperor joked
the poet on his short, stout figure. In Horace's later years his
health was poor. While fond of mixing with society, he hada

, sical time is ξ. While Horace adopted his measures from the

Greeks, he is more strict thau his models in certairi points. He
always uses an irrational spondee in place os a trochee before the
first cyclic dactyl (- > Ι -υ υ, and not — υ Ι -υ υ) ; and if an
apparent choriambus -υ o Ιι] is followed by a second apparent
choriambus in the same verse, the caesura regularly separates the
two.

The following logaoedic verses are used by Horace:

45. The Adonic: ’
Δ. o t L o

terruit Ι urbem s
(This may also be read Ᾰυ υ Ι Ll- Ι Ξ Λ)

46. The Ara'sloplranic:

-ωυιέ 011>
Lydia Ι dic per Ι omnes s
(Thismayalsobereadloollu Ι ΜΙ ΞΛ)

47. The Pherecratic (read as a syncopated tetrapody catalectic) :

L> Ι -sv υ Ι [1th
grato Ι Pyrrha rub Ι αηΙίνο

48. The Glyconic:

L>l -ιυ υΙ L 0!th
sicta Ι diva poltens Cyl pri

i.e. that both equal Ι ᾗ whereas the irrational spondee must be represented
in musical notation by m.. Furthermore the musical equivalent of the

cyclic dactyl‚ as commonly expressed, -υ υ = Μ 2, is hardly correct3

it should rather be §.wa In the schemes as here given the form -υ υ
is used when the caesura does not fall within the foot or falls between the two
short syllables, -υ ΙΙ υ; when the caesura occurs aster the long syllable the

foot is written — Ι w.
lThis combination was regarded by the later Roman writers as a choriam-

bus, - υ υ -, and many still give the name ‘ choriambic ' to metres in which
this succession of syllables occurs.

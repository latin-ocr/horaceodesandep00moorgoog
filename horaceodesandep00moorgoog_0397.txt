HORATI

(C. S. 13 ff.); and on the third night a sow big with young was sacri·
ficed to Tellus (C. S. 29 ff.).1

After the sacrifice of the first night, scenic representations were
begun on a stage without scats lor the audience, and continued uninter-
ruptedly throughout the festiva13 beginning with the first day, however,
they were given in a theater erected sor the occasion (ludi Latt'ni in
theatro lignee qued erat constitutum ire campo seeundum Tiberim).

On the first day Augustus and Agrippa each sacrificed a white bull
to Jupiter on the Capitol,an the following day each a white cow to .
Juno in the same place3 on the third day, when the festival reached its
climax, Augustus and Agrippa offered consecrated cakes to Apollo and
Diana at the temple of Apollo on the Palatine (cf. introductory n. to 1,
31) 3 and then twenty-seven boys and a like number of girls especially
chosen ior this service, sang the hymn which Horace had written for the
occasion, and repeated iton the Capitol (sacrficzbque perficio pueri
X X Vll quibus denuntiatum et puellae totidem earrnen cecinerunt ,· eodem·
que neoda in Capelolze. Carmen eorrzpesuit Q. Horateies Flaccus). ln
addition to these ceremonies 110 matrons conducted sellesternia to
Juno and Diana on each day, and ludi circenses and ledi honorarii
were continued seven days (June 4·¹1) after the close of the festivals

The ode itself lacks the grace and ease of most ol Horace's lyric
verse3 its formal phrases when read seem stiff and rigid. Doubtless

1 The verses oi the oracle ordering these ceremonies are as follows :—

μεμνῆσθαι, Ῥωμαῖε, . . .

ῥέζειν ἐν πεδίῳ παρὰ θύβριδος ἄπλετον ὕδωρ,
ὅππῃ στεινότατον, νὺξ ἡνίκα γαῖαν ἐπέλθῃ,
ἠελίου κρύψαντας ἑὸν φάος· ἔνθα σὺ ῥέζειν
ίεριὶ παντογόνοις Μοίραις ἄρνας τε καὶ αἶγας
κυανέας, ε’πὶ ταῖς δ’ Εἰλειθυίας ἀρέσασθαι
παιδοτόκονς θυέεσσιν, ὅπῃ θέμις· αὖθι δὲ Γαίῃ
πληθομένη χοίροις ivs ίρεύοιτο με’λαινα.

²The oracle prescribes these rites also in detail:-

πάνλευκοι ταῦροι δὲ Διὸς παρὰ βωμὸν ἀγέσθων
ἤματι μηδ’ ἐπὶ sumt· . . .

. . . δαμάλης δὲ βοὸς δέμας ἀγλαὸν Ἤρης
δεξάσθω νηὸς παρὰ σεῦ. καὶ Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων,
ὅστε καὶ ἠέλιος κικλήσκεται, ἶσα δεδέχθαι
θύματα Λητοΐδης, καὶ ἀειδόμενοί τε Λατῖνοι
παιᾶνες κούροισι κόρῃσί τε νηδν ἔχοιεν
ἀθανάτων. χωρὶς δὲ κόραι χορὸν αὐτοὶ ἔχοιεν,
καὶ χωρὶς παίδων ἅρσην στάχυς, ἀλλὰ γονήων
πάντες ζωόντων, οἶς ἀμφιθαλὴς ε’τι φύτλη,

αἰ δὲ γάμου ζεύγλαισι δεδμημένοι ἤματι κείνῳ
γνὺξ Ἤρης παρὰ βωμδν ἀοίδιμον ἑδριόωσαι
δαίμονα λισσίσθωσαν,

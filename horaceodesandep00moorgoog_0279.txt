daughters os Danaus, wh0, compelled to marry their cousins, Aegyptus’
fifty sons, were forced by their father to promise to kill their husbands
on their wedding night, —a crime for which they suffered eternal pun·
ishment. They had a constant reminder of the myth in the statues ol
Danaus and his daughters, which occupied the intercolumnary spaces
ol the portico to the temple of Apollo on the Palatine. Cf. introductory
n. to 1, 313 Prop. 3, 29, 33 Ovid Trist. 3, 1, 61. The story is essentially
narrative, and proper for epic treatment, but Horace wisely selected for
his lyric form a single part of the myth-the story of Lycneus and Hy-
permestra, and from this chose the dramatic moment when Hyper-
mestra rouses her husband and bids him flee for his life. The same
good taste is shown in his treatment of the story of Europa 3, 273 but
both odes are in marked contrast to 1,15. Ovid followed Horace in
handling of the theme in his Heroides 14. The treatment there should
be carefully compared with this. Metre, 69.

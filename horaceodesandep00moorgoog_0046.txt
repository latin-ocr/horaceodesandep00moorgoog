Epod. 17. The caesura occurs after the prefix in imttplumibus,
Epod. 1, 19 3 and in Η aestuet, Epod. 11, 15. The irrational spondee
is not infiequently'substituted in the first, third, and fifth feet ;
the tribrach is used chiefly in the second and third feet, rarely i'n
the first and fourth; the dactyl is found in the first foot, rarely in
the third; and the anapaest is possibly to be read in the first foot
twice (Epod. 2, 35 pauidum, 65 positos) and three times in the
fifth (Epod. 2, 35 laqueo, 5, 79 inferius, 11, 23 mulr'erculum);
yet some of these cases may be read by synizesis as iambs (cf. 38).

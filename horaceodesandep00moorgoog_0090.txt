CARMINA

Quid latet, ut marinae
filium dicunt Thetidis sub lacrimosa Troiae
15 funera, ue virilis
cultus in caedem et Lycias proriperet catervas?

1311. A post-Homeric legend Here he was discovered by Ulys-
told how Thetis, at the outbreak ses, who carne in disguise as a
of the Trojan war, knowing the peddler bringing wares intended
fate that awaited her son, Achilles, to attract the attention of girls3
if he went to Troy, hid him iu there were also in his pack some
maiden’s dress among the daugh- weapons, by handling which Achil-

(Cf. Bion 2, 15 ff. λάνθανε δ’ ἐν is told by Ovid Met. 13, 162 ff.;

‘The world is bound in the letters ol snow and ice. Heap high the
fire to break the cold3 bring out the wine. Leave all else to the gods3
whate'er to-morrow's fate may give, count as pure gain. To-day is
thine for love and dance, while thou art young.'

The first two strophes at least are based on an ode of Alcaeus

of which we still have six verses3 the setting only is ltalian. Alc.
Frg. 34 ὕει μὲν ὀ Ζεύς, ἔκ δ’ ὀράνω μέγας Ι χείμων, πεπάγασιν δ’
ὑδάτων ῥόαι. Ι. . . κάββαλλε τὸν χείμων’, ἐπὶ μὲν τίθεις Ι πῦρ, ε’ν δὲ
κίρναις οἶνον ἀφειδέως Ι μέλιχρον, αὐτὰρ ἀμφὶ κόρσᾳ Ι μαλθακὸν
ἀμφιΙβαλὼν) γνόφαλλον. ‘Zeus sends down rain, and from the sky
there falls a mighty winter storm3 frozen are the streams.⁸ Break down
the storm by heaping up the fire; mix sweet wine ungrudgingly, and
throw round thy head sweet lavender' The last lour strophes are
apparently Horace's own. The theme is the same as that of Epod. 13.

3, 29, 1] HORATI

and his flock seek the shade and cool, and every breeze is stilled. Yet
thou art anxious for our state and fear our furthest border foes (17-28).
All that is wrong. God has hidden the future from man's sight and
laughs at mortals’ anxious care. Deal with the present and be satisfied;
for all besides goes like a stream, now quiet, now wild (29-41). He
shall be master of himself who lives the present hour, that single gift
Heaven cannot take back (41-48). Darne Fortune plays with man,
but I will not be her sport. lf she be kind, 'tis well3 but if she fly
away, l am unchanged with honor still. No timid trader l to bargain
with the gods to save my goods when the southwester blows. Nay, from
the storm my little boat and the Twin Gods will keep me still unharmed

( The last place before the epilogue in his collected lyrics Horace thus
gives to the friend and patron to whom he had dedicated the three
books. See introductory n. to 1, r. Maecenas' care for the well-being
of the state and anxiety over possible foreign foes furnish Horace an
opportunity to urge again the wisdom of thinking solely of the present
hour3 that only that which we already have is surely ours. He then
goes to develop in his own manner a kindred theme-independence
of the whims of fortune.

The allusions in vv. 26-28 seem to fix the date as 26-25 B.c., when
Augustus was absent in the West. Metre, 68.

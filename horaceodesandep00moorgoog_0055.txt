THE ἀπὸ κοινοῦ CONSTRUCTION

roo. Occasionally a word is so placed with reference to two
other words that it may grammatically be connected with either,
while logically it is necessarily so connected: 2, 11, 11f. qnid
aeternis minorem l consiliis onimnm fatigas? In this consiliis
belongs equally to minorem and to fatigas.

THE VERB

ror. A singular verb is frequently used with two or more sub·
jects: 3, 16, 29 ff. rrbns nqnoe silvaque. . . segetis certo fides
. . .sollit. ’

102. The future indicative is occasionally used with permissive
or hortatory force: 1, 7, 1 laudabunt olii cleram Rhodon,
‘others may praise,’ etc.; 1, 12, 57 ff. le minor lotum reget
oeqnns orbem, ete, ‘let him rule,’ etc.

103. The perfect is used like the Greek gnomic aorist, to ex-

press what has always been true or customary, ie. a general truth
or customary action: 1, 28, 20 nnllnm soevo eopnt Proserpina
fogia, ‘cruel Proserpina never passes by (tle. never has, and there-
fore, by implication, never does, pass) a mortal’

PROHIBITIONS

bition, consisting of the imperative with nc: 1, 28, ²3 ne parce ,
herenae, ‘spare not the saud!

Occasionally a circumlocutionis employed : 1, 9, 13 suge qnae-
νινε, ‘avoid asking’3 1, 38, 3 mitte sectori, ‘give up hunting.'

INFINITIVE

105. The ‘historical’ infinitive is found but once in the Epodes,
not in the Odes: Epod. 5, 84 puer inm non . . . lenire verbis

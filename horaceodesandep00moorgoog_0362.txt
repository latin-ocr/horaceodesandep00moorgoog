CARMINA

6

A prelude to the Carmen Saecularc.

‘Apollo, thou who didst punish Niobe and Tityos, and didst lay low
Achilles forali his prowess3 he who but for thee and Venus would have
slain ruthlessly every Trojan child, so that none would have remained
to found another state with better auspices (1-24). Thou divine min-
strel, guard, l pray, the glory oi the Daunian Muse (25-28). Phoebus
it is who gives me my power and name. Ye noble maids and boys,
mark well the measure. Sing Apollo and Diana. Proud shall be thy
boast when matron that at the great festival thou didst render the song
of the poet Horace (29-44).'

The poem thus falls into two divisions— the prayer to Apollo (1-28)‚
and the address to the chorus oi boys and girls that is to sing the Secu·
lar Hymn (31-44). The two parts are connected by vv. 29-30, in
which Horace acknowledges that he owes his inspiration, slrill, and even
name of poet to the god. The date of composition is evidently not far
from that of the Carmen Saeculare, 17 nc. iletre, 69.

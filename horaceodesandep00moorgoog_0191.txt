So Horace once made determined sans. cf. 2, 5, 6.—senes parci:
vows, but still returned to his heart- who know she will squeeze their

Horace exhorts his friend Valgius to give up mourning for his favor·
ite Mystes.

‘Winter rains and winds are not eternal, Valgius. lt is not always
the gloomy season. Yet you weep without ceasing(1-12). Not so did
Nestor mourn for his Antilochus, nor Troilus' relatives for his loss. Give
up your weak plaints, and rather sing the triumphs of Augustus Caesar
(13-24)·'

The reproof at the end runs into a celebration ol the Emperor's deeds,
and shows the court poet. The name Augustus (v. 19) proves that the
date of composition is later than 27 ao, but it cannot be more exactly
fixed. See, however, notes to vv. zoff.

C. Valgius Ruqu, consul suffectus in 12 B.c., was ah elegiae poet
belonging to lllaecenas' circle. According to the Scholiast, Vergil al·
ludes to his elegiae verses in E 7, 22. An epic was apparently expected
from him. Pseudo-Tibul. 4, 1, 179 f. est tibi, qui possit magmi- re accin-
gere rebus, Ι Valgius: aeterno proptor non alter Homero. We hear
also of his rhetorical and medical works, but none of hiswritings are
preserved to us. His friendship with Horace is further attested by S.
1, 10, 81 f. Plotius et Varias, Maecenas Vergiliusque, Ι Valgius et
prabet aaa Octavius. Metre, 68.

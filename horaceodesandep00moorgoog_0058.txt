HORATI CARMINA

LIBER PRIMVS
I

This ode forms the prologus to the three books of lyrics published
by Horace in 23 nc. After the first two lines addressed to Maecenas,
which virtually dedicate the whole collection to him, Horace rehearses
the various interests of men, that at the end he may present his own .
ambition. ‘Some men seek fame in athletic games or in politics (3-8)
others have lower aims—richeS‚ ease, war, or hunting (9-28); butas
for me, l have the loftiest aim of all, Maecenas— to wear the ivy wreath
and be the Muse's dear companion (29-34).' The ode was clearly
written after the collection was fairly complete3 that is, not long before
the actual publication. Metre, 53.

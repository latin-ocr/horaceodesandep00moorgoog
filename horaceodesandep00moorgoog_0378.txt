Ο crudelis adhuc et Veneris muneribus potens,
insperata tuae cum veniet pluma superbiae

et quae nunc umeris involitant deciderint comae,
nunc et qui color est puniceae flore prior rosae

An invitation to Phyllis to join in celebrating the birthday of Mae·
cenas.

‘Come Phyllis, here is plenty, and my house is all abustle with -our
preparations (1-12). We must keep the birthday of Maecenas, dearer
to me almost than my own (13-20). Telephus is not for thee, but for
a maid os richer station. Remember it was ambition that brought low
Phaethon and Bellerophon. Come then, last of my flames, and leam a
song to lessen thy love cares (αι-36).Ἱ

ln theme and treatment this ode is not unlike 3, 28.= lt is interest-
ing to note that it contains the only reference to Maecenas in this book,
which is so largely devoted to the praise os Augustus and his stepsons:
but the warmth of vv. 17-20 shows that no shadow had fallen on the
friendship between Horace and his patron. The year of composition is
unknown. Metre, 69.

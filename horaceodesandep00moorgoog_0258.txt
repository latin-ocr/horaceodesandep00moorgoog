‘While Jove is sovereign of the sky and Augustus rules on earth,
can it he that Crassus' disgraceful defeat is yet unavenged! Has a
Roman soldier so forgotten his hirthright as to live under a Median
King, married to a barbarian wife! lt was this very thing that Regu·
lus' wise mind foresaw when he opposed the ransoming of our soldiers
captured by the CarthaginianS‚ a precedent fraught with ill for later times·
(1-18). . . . “No,” he said, ‘⁴ let those who yielded die; will they be
braver when bought back? No, let thern stay, for they have brought
disgrace upon their native ltaly (19-40).” So like one disgraced he
put aside his wile and child, and stood with downcast eyes, until the
Senate had agreed to his proposal; then he hurried back to torture
and to death with heart as light as for a hollday (41—56).'

The ode thus treats of the degeneracy of the Roman arms and the
loss of military prestige which Augustus was to remedy and revive. ln
the first strophe the allegory of the preceding ode gives way to plain

speech.6'8The date of composition is shown by v. 3 to be 27-26 nc.

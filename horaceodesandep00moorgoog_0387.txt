4, 14, 1] HORATI

the brothers may have been intended to please Augustus, with whom
Drusus was more of a favorite than his brother. The position of the
ode in the book is thought by many to be due to the same cause3 but
it is more probable that Horace placed it and its companion ode, the
fifteenth, at the end, that he might close the book with the Emperor's
praise. The date of composition must be about the same as that of the
fourth ode, ie. 14 nc. Metre, 68.

7. arrangement and character ot the Odes-In arranging his
lyrics lor publication, Horace placed at the beginning eleven odes,
each in a different metre, illustrating all the measures employed by
himin the three books with the exception of the unique rhythms
in 2, 18 3 3,12.¹ Within this group certain other principles of
arrangement can be detected. The first word is Maecenas, and
the opening poem virtually dedicates the three books to their
author’s ⁴friend and patron, to whom he had already inscribed his
Satires and Epodes. The second ode celebrates Octavian as the
divine restorer of order in the state; the third is a larewell poem
to Vergil; the fourth is addressed to Sestius, consul in the year of
publication. The others are arranged to secure variety in subject
as well as measure, a principle that is observed generally through·
out the three books, so that grave themes are relieved by light,
and a succession of similar metres is for the most part avoided.
The second book opens with an ode to Asinius Polli0, celebrating
his literary powers and touching sadly on the Civil Wars of which
Pollio was about to undertake a history. In the first six odes of
the third book, Horace comes lorward as the teacher ol the new
generation, and deals earnestly with the problems and dangers os
· the state. This is the largest group of odes on related themes,
and the A'lcaic metre is used in all; but, as if to avoid wearying his
reader, Horace did not insert another ode iu the same measure
until the seventeenth. He had also some regard for chronological
sequence, but this was always subordinate to the principle os
variety. Each book, τοο, has certain¹ characteristics. In the first
there are a larger number os studies from the Greek than in the

other two, about hals the odes are on themes os love and wine3
nowhere is any serious philosophy of life presented, and only five
(2, 12, 14, 35, 37) show deep concern with the state. As if to
emphasize his character as the singer ol light themes, and at the
same time to offset the serious notes in odes 35 and 37, Horace

lThe tenth ode, while in Sapphic measure like the second, still exhibits
certain metrical peculiarities.

The Italian Mercury was early identified with the Greek Hermes,
but was chiefly worshiped by the Romans as the god of trade.
This ode is a hymn to Mercury with the varied attributes of his
Greek parallel: he is celebrated as the god of eloquence (λόγως), of
athletic contests (ἀγώνιος), the divine messenger (διάκτορος), the in-
ventor of the lyre (ponderis), the god of thieves (κλέπτης), the helper
(ἐριούνιος), and the shepherd of the shades (ψυχοπομπός), who restrains
them with his golden wand (χρυσόρραπις). That this ode is based on
a similar ode by Alcaeus is expressly stated by Porphyrio, hymnus est
in Mercurium ab Alcaeo lyrr'co poeta, who adds on v. 9 fabrcla hacc
autem ab Alcaeo ficta, furthermore Pausanias (7, 20, 5) informs us that
’ Alcaeus treated ina hymn the theft of cattle from Apollo, but Menander
(dc cncom. 7) says that the chief theme of the hymn was the birth of
the god, so that we may safely conclude that Horace's treatment of his
original was free. Unfortunately but three verses of Alcaeus' hymn are
preserved, Frg. 5 χοῖρε Κυλλάνας δ μέδεις, σὲ γάρ μοι( θῦμος ὖμνην,
τὸν κορυφαῖς ἒν aurae Ι Μαῖα γε’ννοτο Κρονίδᾳ μιγεῖσα. Metre, 69.

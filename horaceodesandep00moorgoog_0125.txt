‘Cheap Sabine wine in modest cups shall be thy drink with me, my ·
dear Maecenas. 1 sealed the jar myself some years ago. Choice
wines thou hast at home, but no Falernian nor Formian grape flavors
my cups'

These verses have the form of an answer to a letter from Maecenas
announcing his intention to visit Horace on his Sabine farm. The
event mentioned in v. 3 ff. fixes the date of composition as after 30 nc.
The ode shows a lack of finish, as if written in haste. Metre, 69.

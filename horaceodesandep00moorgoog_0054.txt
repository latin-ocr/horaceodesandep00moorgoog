SYNTAX [tter-99

‘the servants freed from toil' 3, 27, 69 abstineto irarum, ‘give

up thy wrath' ’
THE ABLATIVE

The simple ablative, without a preposition, is used somewhat
more sreely than in prose.

95. The simple ablative is used to express the place where an
action occurs: 1, a, 9 samma haesit alma, ‘clung in the top of
the elm.' 1, 9, 10 f. ventas aequare seraiila depraeliana's, ‘winds
struggling over the yeasty deep.' 1, 32, 8 religarat litare navim,
‘anchored his ships off the shore,’ also belongs here.

96. Once in the Odes the ablative of agent is used without a
preposition: 1, 6, 1 fscriberis Varia . . . Maeonii carminis alite,
‘thou shalt be sung by Varius, that bird of Maeonian song.¹
With this we may compare Epist. 1, 19, 2 carmina, qaae scriban-
tur aquae pateribus, ‘verses written by teetotalerS,’ although most
editors and grammarians regard palarz'bas as dative of agent.
While the phrase Varia . . . alite approaches the ablative abso-
lute, the difference between it and such cases as S. 2, 1, 84 iudice
laudatas Caesare must not be overlooked.

97. The instrumental ablative is found once with a verbal noun:
3, 4, 55 truncia iaculator, ‘he who threw trunks of trees!

98. With arata and a direct object the ablative is used to denote
both that which is given and that which is received in exchange3
the context alone shows the relation: 1, 17, 1 f. Lucretilem mutat
Lycaeo, ‘exchanges Lycaeus sor Lucretilis.’ The opposite 1, 16,
²5 f. ega mr'tz'bas matare quaero tra'saa, ‘I seek to substitute kind
feelings for bitterness)

‘TRANSFERRED' ADJECTIVES ,

99. An adjective which naturally expresses some quality of a
person or thing is sometimes transferred to an object or action
which is associated with that person or thing: 1, 3, 38ff. neqae Ι
per nastrum patimur scelus Ι iracunda lavem ponere fulmina ,·
1, 15, 33 f. iracunda . . . classis Achillei.

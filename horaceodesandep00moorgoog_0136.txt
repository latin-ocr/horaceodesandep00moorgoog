‘Beloved by the Muses l can throw to the winds all fears of dangers
frorn abroad. Sweet Muse, weave a chaplet for my Lamia,l pray.
My verse is naught without thee. Celebrate him in Lesbian song)

The Lamia here addressed has been identified with L. Aelius
Lamia, one of the two sons of Cicero's friend and supportes, L. Aelius
Lamia who was praetor 43 nc. (Cic. adsum. 11, 16, ²3 pro Sest.
29). Lamia must have been young at the time this ode was written,
for he was consul in 3 An). and praefectus urbi in 32 Aa). He died the
following year. Tacitus, Ana. 6, 27, mentions him, gemes illi decorum
vivida senectam· Velleius Paterculus describes him (2, 116, 3), vir an-
tiqm'ssimi neoris, et priscam gravitatem semper hiernanitate temperans.

The most probable date of composition is that suggested by the refer·
ences in vv. 3-5‚ as 30 B.c.; the words fidibus nevis, v. 10, cause some
critics to regard this as one of Horace's earliest attempts in Alcaic verse3
a view that finds support from the somewhat harsh caesura in v. 11
Lesbio ll sacrare plectro. Metre, 68.

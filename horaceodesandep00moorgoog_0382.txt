cinnum [4126

drink a cup of choice wine at my house, bring a box of precious nard
with thee. Let go thy cares and give thyself up to our revel (13-28).'

This is the third of Horace's poems on this theme, but whereas in
the others (1, 4 and 4, 7) he employs the changes of the year to
remind us of the fleeting character of life, here he gives the matter a
more cheerful turn with only a glauce (v. 26) at the gloomy world
below. The invitation is not unlike that of Catullus (C. 13) to his
friend Fabullus to dine with him and provide all the entertainment save
the unguent only.

The Vergil addressed cannot be the poet, who died in 19 n.c.; but
we know nothing more of him than the ode tells uss Some critics
think that the similarity of v. 21 to v. 13 f. of the preceding ode shows
that they were written at about the same time. Metre, 72.

A propempticon to the poet Mevius, hated by Horace and the circle
to which he belonged. Vergil has secured immortality for Mevius and
his associate Bavius by his verses E. 3, 90 f. qui Bavium non odr't,
amet tua carmz'rza, Mevi3 l atquc idem rittigat vzclpes et mulgeat hircos.
The ill-nature of Horace's poem should be compared with the good
wishes in the propempticon addressed to Vergil C. 1, 3.

That this epode also is modeled un a poem by Archilochus is shown
by a fragment recovered from a papyrus sheet in 1899.l The begin-
ning, which probably contained the name of the poet's false friend, is
lost3 the fragment, as restored, is as follows:

κύμ<ατι> πλα<ζόμ)ενος,

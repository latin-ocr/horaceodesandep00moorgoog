An appeal to the Romans not to renew civil war, written probably in
38 lac. on the eve of the outbreak of hostilities between the triumvirs
and Sextus Pompey. ln August, 39 B.c.,·a treaty between the opposing
parties signed at Misenum had raised the hope that the exhausted
Roman world might have an opportunity to recover itself in peace; but
within a year these hopes were disappointed. lt was most natural then
that Horace should express himself in this gloomy way; later he was

more hopeful of the state. Notice the dramatic form of which Horace
is fond. He makes a personal appeal to the opposing lines. Metre, 74.

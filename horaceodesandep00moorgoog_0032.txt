was almost entirely neglected.¹ Yet the number of Mss. earlier
than the thirteenth century—nearly twenty date from the eighth‚
ninth, and tenth-attest the esteem in which all the works were
held in mediaeval cloisters.

In the Renaissance and modern times ·Horace's popularity has
been great. Over seventy editions, partial or complete, were
printed before 1500. There have been many would-be imitators
of Horace's lyric verse in the last four centuries, but no better
proof of the perfectiori of his art can be found than in the marked

- inferiority of all attempts, both ancient and modern, to repeat his
measures. It is not exaggeration to say that no one since Horace's
day has written Latin Alcaies or Sapphics that deserve to be com-
pared with their models. Naturally Horace's influence on modern
writers of lyric verse hasbeen marked. To illustrate this here is not
possible, but there is hardlya lyricist who has not felt his spell.
Among contemporary English writers, Austin Dobson's methods
and verses remind us most of the Roman bard. Yet Horace’s
lasting popularity is attested, not so much by literature, as by the
regard in which men of varied pursuits hold him. His wisdom,
his moderatiori and good-humored satire, coined into perfect
form, have won him an unique place in the affections of mankind.

re more good manuscripts of Horace preserved than of any
other Latin writer except Vergil, they number about 2 50, dating
from the eighth (or ninth) to the fifteenth century. All seem -to
come from a common early archetype, but the cross lines of tra·
dition are so numerous that it is impossible to classify them satis·
factorily. The most important are : -

(1) Codex Blandr'm'us Vetustissimos. This manuscript was
formerly in the Abbaye de St. Pierre on Mt. Blandin‚ near Ghent,
but was burn'ed when the Abbey was destroyed by fire in 1566.
It wasone of the four manuscripts borrowed from the monastery

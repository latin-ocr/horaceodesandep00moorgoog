An address to a jar of wine, which Horace will broach in honor of
his friend Corvinus.

Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus was a student in Athens with
Horace, and like him served in Brutus’ army in 42 B.c.; later he took
part in the struggle against Antony. He was consul in 31 B.c.‚ and in
27 iac. enjoyed a triumph over the Aquitanians. After this he devoted
himself to the practice of law and the pursuit and patronage of litera-
ture. His eloquence is praised by Cicero (ad Brut. 1, 15, 1); Quin-
tilian (10. 1, 113) compared his oratory with that of Asinus Pollio.
Messala's great wealth and high social position niade it possible for him
to gather about him a literary circle second only to that of Maecenas.
Tibullus was the most distinguished of this company, and has left many
references in his verses to his patron.

The ode is dramatically conceived: the poet stands before the jars
stored in his apotheca and bids one contemporary with himself come
down and yield up its store. whether it contain sport or contentiori.
As the gossip of tradition credits Messala with being a connoisseur of
wines, vv. 7·¹0 possibly refer to his ability. The date of composition

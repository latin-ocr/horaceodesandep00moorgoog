The following ode seems to have been called forth by Maecenas·
gloomy forebodings that his end was near. He was a great sufferet
from insomnia and lever, but shrank from death. The verses open with
arebuke‚ but presently become an assurance of the deepest affection:
the very gods have willed that the poet shall not outlive his friend.
Moreover‚ the hour set by the F ates is not yet come, else Maecenas had
not recovered from his last illness and Faunus had not saved Horace from
thefallingtree. So then they both must offer tothe gods the sacrificesdue.

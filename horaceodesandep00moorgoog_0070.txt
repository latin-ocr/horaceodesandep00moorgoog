A propemplicon, oriarewell poem, to Vergil. ‘Ship that bearest Ver-

giltoGreece, deliverhim safe‚lpray. (1-8.) That mortal was overbold
who first dared tempt the sea (9-24); of old man stole fire from Heaven
and by that act brought ou himself disease and early death (25-33);
he essays the air itself aud does not shrink to pass the very bars os
Acheron (34-36). Nothing is saie from him; through pride and sin
he still calls down the wrath of Jove' Cf. with this the ill-natured
propempticon to Mevius, Epod. ro.

Vergil's only voyage to Greece, so iar as we know, was iu 19 ac,
tour years after the first three books oi the Odes were published.
Therefore we must believe that a visit to Athens was at least planned
by him before 23 rac· or that Horace is here addressing another
Vergil than the poet. The second alternative can be rejected.
No other Vergil could have been called by Horace atrimae dimidiatur
nacae without receiving mention elsewhere, save possibly 4, 12, 13·
For Horace's relation to Vergil, see lutr. 5, Sellar's Vr'rgr'l, pp.
rao-126.

ltis remarkable that aiter the first eight verses which contain the
propempticon proper, Horace, who was usually so tactful, should quickl y
revert to the old philosophical and theological notions of the sinfulness
oi human enterprise without observing how out of place such ideas were
here, when Vergil was just about to show such enterprise by undertaking
this voyage.

lt isprobable that the form of the propempticon was suggested by a
poem οἱ Callimachus, oi which two verses are preserved. Frg. 114

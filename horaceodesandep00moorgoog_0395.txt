CARMEN SAECVLARE

. -4—

Horace's pree'minent art was officially recognized in 17 nc. by his
appointment to write the hymn for the celebration of the ludi saecu·
lares. This festival originated in a worship of the gods of the lower
world hythe gens Valeria at a spot in the Campus Martius called
Terentum (or Tarentum), near the bend in the river not far below the
present Ponte San Angelo. ln 249 rae, after the defeat at Drepanum,
some fearful portents prompted a consultatiou of the Sibylline Books:
these ordered a celebration of the ludi Tarentini, and further directed
that the festival should be repeated every hundred years Thus the gen-

but 146 13.c.; the confusion of 49 nc. must have prevented any thought

misfortune which then threatened the state and the emperor-the bad
harvest with its attendant hardship and Augustus' sickness (cf. Intr.
n. to 1, 21 and n. to 1, 21, 6). For some unknown reason the celebra-

decade for which Augustus in January, 27 B.c., had undertaken the
direction of the state. In this ten years the Roman world had revived
under the blessings of peace and had seemed to enter on anew era.
Augustus proposed to celebrate the close of this period bya revival
of the ludi saeculares in new and magnificent form.

To obtain religious sanction for his plan he applied to the quinde-
cimviri, the college in charge of the Sibyllino Books, who took 110
years as the length of the saeculum,— antiquarians differed as to whether
roo or 110 years was the correct number,—and on this basis pointed
to four previous dates for celebrations beginning with 456 B.c.3 the

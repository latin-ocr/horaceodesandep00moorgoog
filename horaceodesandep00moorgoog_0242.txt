CARMINA

3

The theme of the third ode is similar to that of the second: the
praise of two great virtues, iustitra and constantia, justice and stead-
fastness of purpose. The ode opens with the famous picture of the
upright and constant man who is unmoved by the fury of the populace
or by the raging elements; the fall of heaven itself would not shake
him (1-8). Such were the qualities which secured immortality for
Pollurr, Hercules, AugustuS, and Quirinus (9-16). Then with the men-
tion of Romulus Horace seems to turn from the theme with which he
began, and reports to us the speech oi Juno before the council of the
goda, in which she gives up in part her hatred toward the Trojans and
their descendants, and prophesies for Rome an empire coterminous
with the world, so long as her people shall keep themselves from avarice
and not try to rebuild llium (ιγ-68). Then he suddenly checks him-
self with a mock reproach to his lyre and muse for venturing on such
mighty themes (69-72).

The introduction of Juno's long speech was apparently due toa
desire to avoid the monotony of a long moral discourse3 it further.
allowed Horace to drive home the lesson he wished to teach by making
it part of Juno's prophecy. The protest against any attempt to rebuild
llium has puzzled commentators. Some take it to refer to a design to
move the capital to llium which rumor had attributed to Julius Caesar.

Alexandream ael Ilium, translatis sr'rrrul apibus r'rrrperr'i. Others regard
it as an allegorical condemnation of Asiatic vice and luxury, which
Rome must avoid if she is to maintain her empire. Both views are
improbable. Horace wished to represent Juno's fateful wrath toward
Hium as but partially appeased: she will allow the descendants of
the Trojans to rule, but only in exile.

The name Augustus (v. 11) shows that the date ol composition is
alter27u.c. Metre, 68.

as his representative with almost complete power 3 and with the
exception os a temporary estrangement in 2 3 nc, when he indis·
creetly betrayed to his wiie Terentia the discovery ol the plot
which her brother, Licinius Murena, was forming against Augustus,
he remained the emperor‘s most trusted adviser. Naturally, when
Augustus’ position was firmly established, Maecenas was to a cer-
tain extent displaced by the members oi the imperial family, but
the friendship between him and Augustus continued to the end.
With all his opportunity and power, Maecenas declined politi-
cal prelerment, and remained a ‘knight' throughout his life. He
had a native taste ior literature, was a master of the Greek lan-
guage, and wrote some mediocre verses himself 3 but it was by his
wise patronage os menos letters that he wona permanent place
in the grateful memory of men. He had no doubt a political pur-
pose in his patronage also, for he saw that literature might be
used to support and establish the new regime. Yet he imposed
no fettering conditions on those to whom he gave his favor: we ’
know (Epod. 14) that he urged Horace to publish his Epodes3
that Vergil wrote the Georgics at his suggestion, that he advised
Propertius to undertake some larger themes; but nowhere is
there any hint that he ever exacted any return for his favor which
would not have been spontaneously made. Of the circle he gath·
ered about him, Vergil, Horace, and Propertius achieved most
permanent fame. Others were L. Varius Rufus, Plotius Tucca,
Quintilius Varus, Domitius Marsus, and C. Melissus. Maecenas
favor assured Horace the friendship of these and many others be·
sides that of Octavian, so that aster 373c. he had entrance into
the best society os his time. His friendship with Maecenas was
commingled with gratitude to him for the material aid he had
given 3 but the relation 'between the two men had so genuinea
basis that Horace could accept Maecenas’ gists without hesitancy,
aware that his friendship was a full return in Maecenas’ mind.
His acceptance, too, involved no loss os independence, and in

many passages he makes it clear that he would readily resign all

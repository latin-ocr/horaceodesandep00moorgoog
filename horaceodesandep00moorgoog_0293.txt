HORATI

15 reges muneribus; munera navium
' saevos inlaqueant duces.

Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam

maiorumque lames; iure perhorrui

late conspicuum tollere verticem,
Maecenas, equitum decus.

Quanto quisque sibi plura negaverit,

ab dis plura feret. Nil cupientium

nudus castra peto et transfuga divitum
partis linquere gestio,

15 f. muneribus, munera: with
bribes‚· yar, brahen! say. lntr. 28b.
-navium duces: some see here a
reference to Menas (or Mene·
dorus), the freedman of Cn. Pom·
pey and admiral of Sextus Pom-
pey, who in 38 rac. deserted to
Octavianus3 afterwards he re-
turned to his earlier allegiance,
only to desert again—saevos:
stern though they be. - inlaqueant:
ensnare.

17 f. crescentem, etc: a com-
mon sentiment. Cf. Theoc. 16,
64 f. ἀνήριθμος δέ οἱ εἴη ἄργυρος,
αἰεὶ δὲ πλεόνων ἔχοι ἵμερος αὐτόν,
‘His be unnumbered wealth, but
may a longing sor more ever pos·
sess him) luv. 14, 139 crescit
amor nunum', quantum ipsopa-
cum'a crevit. — fames: cf. Epist.
1, 18, 23 argenti sitis importuna
famesquc; Verg. Α. 3, 57 auri
sacrasames.

19 f. late conspicuum: prolep-
tic, so etat it could be seen asor.
-equitum decus: Maecenas was

a good example of the moderation
Horace is urging: although pos·
sessed of great wealth and influ-
ence, he modestly declinedpolitical
preferment. Cf. n. to 1, 1, 1 ; 20, 5.

211. plura. . . plura: the
context in this paradox shows the
meaning. By the first plura Hor·
ace means money and the unes·
sential things vwhich it procures,
‘this world's goods'3 by the sec·
ond, the real goods which cannot
be bought, but are gists from
heaven,-a contented mind and
ability to find happiness in simple
things. -nil cupientium: and so
content. cf. Maximian. 1, 54 et
rerum dozm'nus nil cupiendo fui.

23 f. nudus: zie. leaving all en·
cumbrances of wealth and luxury.
-transfugaz continuing the figure
of the soldier eager to leave the
party (partis) to which he now
belongs, and fiee to the opposite
camp-divitum: and therefore
discontent, contrasted with nil
cupientium.

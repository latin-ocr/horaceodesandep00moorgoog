LIBER SECVNDVS

Ι

As the first three odes of the first book are given in order to Maece
nas, Octavianus, and Vergil, so this book opens with odes addressed to
three friends, Pollio, Sallustius CrispuS, and Dellius. The place of
honoris given to C. Asinius Polli0, who was one of the most distin·
guished menos his time; born in 76 nc. he belonged in his youth to
the literary circle of Catullus, CalvuS, and Cinna. He had an honorable
political and military career, attaining the consulship in 40 1³.c.; his
military serviceS, in the course of which he served under Caesar and
after Caesar's murder under Antony, culminated in a successful cam·
paign against the Parthini, a tribe in Dalmatia, in 3913.ss With tlte
booty gained he founded the first public library in Rome.

From this time he gave himself up to literary and forensic pursuits,
maintaining with honora neutral position in the struggle between
Octavianus and Antony. Quintilian, Seneca, and Tacitus praise his
oratory (cs. 13 f.) in which he had hoped to rival Cicer03 his tragedies
(11-12) were celebrated in 39nc. by Vergil (E. 8, ιο) assola Sophocleo
tua carmina digna cothurno. Horace refers to them in the verse (S.
1, 10, 42 f.) Pollio regum l facta canit pede ter percrrsso. Following pos·
sibly the example of Sallust, he undertook to write a history of the civil
wars, with the first triumvirate, 60 Bc, as his starting point. We do
not know to what date Pollio intended to bring his work—it undoubt-
edly included Pharsalus, Thapsus, and probably Philippi, —or whether
he completed his plan, whatever it may have been; for while the work
is referred to by Tacitus and Suetonius. it is to us entirely lost Our
knowledge of his literary ability is based solely on his letters to Cicero
(ad.fam. 10, 31-33) which show a stiff and archaic style3 an attempt
in recent years to ascribe to him the bellum Africum and a portion ol
the bellum Alexandrinum has utterly failed. Pollio first introduced
the practice ol reading portions os one's works to a circle οἱ friends
(recitationes), which became a regular habit under the empire, and we

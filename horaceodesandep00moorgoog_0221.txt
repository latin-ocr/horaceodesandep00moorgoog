HORAT 1

aedemque votivam memento ;
nos humilem feriemus agnam.

Cf. 2. 7. 17 ergo obligatam redde in their estate. So Horace seyr
incaeperat-victimas: ie. many (4. 2, 53 f.) to his rich fn'enl
large cattle. Julius Antonius te decem tarr

32. humilem . . . agnam: in totidemque vaccae, Ι me tener ul·
playful reference to the difference vei vitrclus.

‘No lordly pile or fortune great is mine, but a kind poetic gilla
little farm, are all that Ι possess. 'Tis quite enough for me. But you
though life is insecure, still build your palaces and grudge the very
sea its shore3 you drive your poor clients from their homes that yur
may satisfy your greed for land. Your sure home is the halis of Death:¹
Earth's doors open for rich and poor alike. No bribes move the grin
ferryman.'

This ode handles again Horace's favorite theme—the vanityof
riches and ambition the wisdom of the golden mean. The same senti
ments are expressed 1, 313 2, 163 3, 1, 40-48. 24. 1 ff. As frequently
elsewhere he takes his own case as an illustration 01 the ideal lot,iu
which man is content with his moderate estate, and contrasts it with
that of the rich man whose greed defles the sacred laws of nature and
of man. Horace has no individual in mind, but with his fondness for
concrete statement gives his verses a dramatic turn by the direct forn
of address. His model may have been a poem of Bacchylides, Frg. 21
Bl. οὐ βοῶν πάρεστι σώματ’, οὔτε χρυσός, l olm πορφύρεα reinna-cel
ἀλλὰ θυμὸς εὐμενής l Μοῦσά τε γλυκεῖα, καὶ βοιωτίοισιν Ι ἐν σκύφοισιν
οἶνος ἡδύς. The date of composition is uncertain. Metre (only here),
82.

Non ebur neque aureum
mea renidet in domo lacunar,

1-5. Horace has in mind the eburnam,- ivory and gold were
splendid airt'a adorned with rare used to adorn the paneis (lacn-
marbles which the rich had begun rzarr'a) of the atrium. Cf. Lucr.

to build toward the end of the Re· 2, 27 f. nec domus argento fulget
public. Cf. n. to 2„ 15, 20.- (retroque renidet l nec citharae re·
ebur: equivalent to the prose boant laqueata aurataque tecta.

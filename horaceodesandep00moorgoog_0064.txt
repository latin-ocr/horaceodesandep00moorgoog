illustrate the growth of this identification‚ at least in the Carnpanian
city. In three of these records (C.l.L. ιο, 885-887), the first two of
which can be dated 14 B.c., the persons attached to the cult of Mer·
cury are called ministri Mercurii Maiae; then no. 888, of uncertain
date, has ministri Augusti Mercuri Muiue3 and finally nos 890-
910, beginning with 2 B.c.‚ have only inruistri Augusti. Later, the
conception of Augustus as identical with Apollo prevailed.

The date of composition falls between the return of Octavian from
the East in ²9 Bc. (cf. v. 49, mugnus—triumphus) and Jan. 13th‚ 27 Bc,
when his imperium was renewed, and he received the new title, Augus-
tus. The most probable date is late in 28 Μ, when Octavian's
suggestion of giving up his power (Dio C. 53, 4, 9) may well have
awakened fears ol the return of civil strif . Metre‚ 69.

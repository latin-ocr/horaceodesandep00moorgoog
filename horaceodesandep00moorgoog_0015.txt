and Holder’s first volume; and Ι have used most of the
important foreign annotated editions especially Orelli's
fourth edition, and those of Schiitz, Kiessling‚ and Mueller.
Although for obvious reasons Ι have avoided consulting
any American edition, l am aware that my debt to Pro-
fessor Smith’s excellent book, which Ι have used in my
teaehing for some years, must be greater than Ι know. ln
the three or four places where Ι have detected direct in-
debtedness, l have acknowledged it.

The notes to the earlier Epodes are rather full, as I
firmly believe that at least Epodes 1, 2, 7, 9, and 16 should
be read before the Odes ; but since many teaehers do not
hold this view Ι have adapted my commentary on the first
book to meet the needs of beginners there also.

Ι am under obligations to many for criticism and help.
My thanks are especially due Miss S. H. Ballou, instructor
in the University of Chicago, for the valuable assistance
she gave me in the earlier part of my work; also to Pro
fessor Morris, who kindly gave me the benefit of his eriti-
cisms on my notes to the first two books of the Odes; but
’ above all to Professor Morgan‚ whose suggestions and
criticisms have been of the greatest value at every stage.
Notiee of errors and suggestions of every kind will be
gratefully received by me.

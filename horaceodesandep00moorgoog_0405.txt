For a general account of the Epodes and the conditions under which
they were written, see lntr. 4.

Addressed to Maecenas in the spring of 31 ac„ when he was
about to leave Rome. Antony and Cleopatra had spent the winter os
32-31 rac. at Patrae, while their fleet of five hundred vessels had
remained on guard at Actium. When the spring opened, Octavian sum-
moned the most influential senators and knights to meet him at Brun·
disium, before he crossed to Epirus to engage in the final struggle.
Maecenas naturally was to go with the rest. Dio Cassius 51, 3, tells us
that Maecenas was left in charge of ltaly during Octavian's absence, so
that it is generally assumed that he was not present at the battle of
Actium. On the other hand, an anonymous elegy, regarded by Biiche
ler as contemporary, speaks os him as actually present cum freta Nilia·
cae texerunt laeta carthae l fivrtis erat circum, soriti el ante ducem.
PLM. r, 122 ff. However, the evidence is inconclusive3 yet it seems
clear from Horace's words that at the time he wrote this epode he ex-
pected Maecenas to share in the dangers of the coming struggle. He
remonstrates with his patron for his readiness to run all risks (1-4);
assures him· of his own devotion and willingness to share every danger,
andos his anxiety‚ if he be forced to stay behind (5-22); and closes
with the protestation that it is not selfish hope of gain that moves him:
Maecenas has given him all he can desire (23-34). The last verses
bear the emphasis of the epode. Horace's devotion is unselfish.

This epode serves as a dedication os the collection to Maecenas.
There is a warmth of expression in it that Horace does not employ
elsewhere. Metre, 74.

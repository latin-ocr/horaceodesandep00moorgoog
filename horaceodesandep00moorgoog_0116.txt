13-16. While the belief that man
possesses the characteristics of the
lower animals is very ancient, the
form of the myth which Horace
gives here is not found in any ear-
lier author-principi: praecepal,
primordial; ¹‘primitive clay)—
coactus: for all the elements had
been exhausted in making the
other animals3 therefore Prome-
theus was obliged to take a por-
tion from each creature (undique)
for man.

15 f. et: evea—leonis vim: ie.
violentiam. -stomacho : as the seat
of passion. Cf. 1, 6,6 Pelidae sto
elenchum cedere nescii.

17. irae: resuming the irae of
v.9.—Thyesten: cf r,6, 8 saevam

Thyestes of Varius had recently

been published when Horace wrote.

its primitive condition. , Propert.

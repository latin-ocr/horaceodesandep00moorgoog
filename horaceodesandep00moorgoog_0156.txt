CARMINA [1‚ 35, 6

of Gray's Ode to Adversityh while Wordsworth used Gray's poem as a
model for his Ode to Duty. =

The expedition referred to in v. 29 f. was undertaken by Augustus
in 27 rac, when, according to Dio C. 53, 22, ἐξώρμησε μὲν ὡς καὶ ἐς τὴν
Βριττανίαν στρατεύσων, ἐς δὲ δὴ τὰς Γαλατιας ελθων curando διέτριψεν.
The following year he again laid pians for the invasion, but was kept
back by an uprising in Spain. ln this year, too, preparations were
being made for the expedition of Aelius Gallus against the Arabians to
which vv. 30-32 refer (cf. ode 29 of this book). 26 Bc. is therefore
the most probable date of the ode. Metre, 68. '
